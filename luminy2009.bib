abstract = "When using Rutishauser's qd-algorithm for the determination of the roots of a polynomial (originally the poles of a meromorphic function), or for related problems, conditions have been formulated for the interpretation of the computed q- and e-values. For a correct interpretation, the so-called critical indices play a crucial role. They index a column of e-values that tends to zero because of a jump in modulus among the poles. For more than 50 years the qd-algorithm in exact arithmetic was considered to be fully understood. In this presentation we push the detailed theoretical investigation of the qd-algorithm even further and we present a new aspect that seems to have been overlooked. We indicate a new element that makes a column of e-values tend to zero, namely a jump in multiplicity among equidistant poles. This result is obtained by combining the qd-algorithm with a deflation technique, and hence mainly relying on Bernoulli's method and Hadamard's formally orthogonal polynomials. Our results round up the theoretical analysis of the qd-algorithm as formulated in its original form, and are of importance in a variety of practical applications as outlined in the introduction. "

Our new result contained in Lemma 3 of the present paper represents a further extension of the class of contours of integration (and, by this, of the class of functions possessing a given asymptotic expansion), allowing the curves to intersect themselves or return back, closer to the origin. Estimates on the remainders are obtained for different types of contours. Methods of reducing the ambiguity by additional inputs are discussed using the particular case of the Adler function in QCD.

This leads to the following conjecture: the series appearing in the formal solutions at infinity, depending on the parameter μ, are in general divergent; they become convergent for some particular values of the parameter, corresponding exactly to the eigenvalues of the prolate operator.

For one-dimensional anharmonic oscillators, one can transform the Schrödinger equation into a Riccati form, i.e., in terms of the logarithmic derivative of the wave function. A perturbative expansion of the logarithmic derivative of the wave function can easily be obtained. The Bohr–Sommerfeld quantization condition can be expressed in terms of a contour integral around the poles of the logarithmic derivative. Its functional form is B m ( E , g ) = n + 1 2 , where B is a characteristic function of the anharmonic oscillator of degree m, E is the resonance energy, and g is the coupling constant. A recursive scheme can be devised which facilitates the evaluation of higher-order Wentzel–Kramers–Brioullin (WKB) approximants. The \{WKB\} expansion of the logarithmic derivative of the wave function has a cut in the tunneling region. The contour integral about the tunneling region yields the instanton action plus corrections, summarized in a second characteristic function A m ( E , g ) . The evaluation of A m ( E , g ) by the method of asymptotic matching is discussed for the case of the cubic oscillator of degree m = 3 . "

abstract = "An important issue that arises in application of convergence acceleration (extrapolation) methods is that of stability in the presence of floating-point arithmetic. This issue turns out to be critical because numerical instability is inherent, even built in, when convergence acceleration methods are applied to certain types of sequences that occur commonly in practice. If methods are applied without taking this issue into account, the attainable accuracy is limited, and eventually destroyed completely, as more terms are added in the process. Therefore, it is important to understand the origin of the problem and to propose practical ways to solve it effectively. In this work, we present a general discussion of the issue of stability within the context of a generalization of the Richardson extrapolation process, and review some of the recent developments that have taken place in the theoretical study of many of the known acceleration methods. We discuss approaches that have been proposed to cope with built-in instabilities when applying various methods, and illustrate the effectiveness of these strategies with some numerical examples. "

Previous to this contribution, the theoretically powerful G n ( 1 ) transformation was handicapped by the lack of an algorithmic implementation. Our proposed algorithm removes this handicap by introducing a recursive computation of the successive G n ( 1 ) transformations with respect to the order n. This recursion, however, introduces the ( x 2 d d x ) operator applied to the integrand. Consequently, we employ the Slevinsky–Safouhi formula I for the analytical and numerical developments of these required successive derivatives. Incomplete Bessel functions, which pose as a numerical challenge, are computed to high pre-determined accuracies using the developed algorithm. The numerical results obtained show the high efficiency of the new method, which does not resort to any numerical integration in the computation. "

abstract = "The well-known algorithm for summing divergent series is based on the Borel transformation in combination with the conformal mapping. A modification of this algorithm allows one to determine a strong coupling asymptotics of the sum of the series through the values of the expansion coefficients. An application of the algorithm to the β-function of φ 4 theory leads to the asymptotics β ( g ) = β ∞ g α at g → ∞ , where α ≈ 1 for space dimensions d = 2 , 3 , 4 . The natural hypothesis arises, that the asymptotic behavior is β ( g ) ∼ g for all d. Consideration of the “toy” zero-dimensional model confirms the hypothesis and reveals the origin of this result: it is related to a zero of a certain functional integral. A generalization of this mechanism to the arbitrary space dimensionality leads to the linear asymptotics of β ( g ) for all d. The same idea can be applied to \{QED\} and gives the asymptotics β ( g ) = g , where g is the running fine structure constant. A relation to the “zero charge” problem is discussed. "

This article wants to show that this neglect is unjustified, and that factorial series are useful numerical tools for the summation of divergent (inverse) power series. This is documented by summing the divergent asymptotic expansion for the exponential integral E 1 ( z ) and the factorially divergent Rayleigh–Schrödinger perturbation expansion for the quartic anharmonic oscillator. Stirling numbers play a key role since they occur as coefficients in expansions of an inverse power in terms of inverse Pochhammer symbols and vice versa. It is shown that the relationships involving Stirling numbers are special cases of more general orthogonal and triangular transformations. "

This approach can be easily applied to the case of generalized or basic hypergeometric series, as well as some orthogonal polynomial expansions. It is closely related to the famous Wynn's epsilon algorithm, Weniger's or Homeier's transformations, and the method introduced by Čížek, Zamastil and Skála. However, it is difficult to use the algorithm proposed by Woźny and Nowak in the general case, because of its high complexity, and some other restrictions. We propose another realization of the Q transformation, which results in obtaining a simpler and faster algorithm. Four illustrative numerical examples are given. "

We recall the basis of the method, for a class of series we give intuitive arguments to explain its convergence and illustrate its properties by several simple examples. Since the method was proposed, some rigorous convergence proofs were given. The method has also found a number of applications and we shall list a few. "
