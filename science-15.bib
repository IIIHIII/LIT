abstract = "An automatic method for obtaining the numerical solution for the simplest problem in the calculus of variations is described. The nonlinear two-point boundary-value Euler-Lagrange equation is solved using the Newton-Raphson method for obtaining successive approximations of the solution. The derivatives required for the solution of the problem are computed automatically using the table method. The user of the program need only input the integrand of the objective function in the calculus-of-variations problem and specify the boundary conditions. None of the derivatives usually associated with the Euler-Lagrange equation and the Newton-Raphson method need be calculated by hand. An example is given with numerical results. The automatic solution of the simplest problem in the calculus of variations in this paper is considered to be the first step in the automatic solution of more general optimal-control problems. "

abstract = "A method is presented for estimating the hydraulic parameters of groundwater flow models under steady- and nonsteady-state conditions. The estimation problem is posed in the framework of maximum-likelihood theory by means of a log-likelihood criterion that includes prior estimates of the parameters. To allow for an incomplete knowledge of the covariances of the prior head and parameter errors, these covariances are expressed in terms of a few unknown statistical parameters that may be estimated jointly with the hydraulic parameters. Computational efficiency is achieved by evaluating the gradient of the estimation criterion with an adjoint-state finite-element scheme and using a combination of conjugate-gradient algorithms, coupled with Newton's method for determining the step size to be taken at each iteration. Model structure identification criteria developed in the time-series literature (all of which utilize the maximum-likelihood concept) are shown to be useful for selecting the best way to parametrize a groundwater flow region when a number of alternative schemes of parametrization are given. The paper also demonstrates the potential utility of the proposed estimation method for the optimum design of space-time measurement networks. A case study dealing with three-dimensional flow in a multiaquifer system is briefly discussed. "

The methodology is especially appropriate when many systems with the same structure must be solved quickly, as in finite-difference models of fluid flow and combustion. The approach features identifying a “canonical form” for such systems and exploiting this canonical form to effect a preliminary algebraic reduction. Then numerical scaling and iterative solution techniques are evoked. Both homotopy continuation and a variant of Newton's method are effective solution methods. This methodology is a significant advance over previous approaches to solving chemical equilibrium systems. The problem of solving such systems has heretofore been regarded as challenging; solution techniques have tended to emphasize case-by-case analyses and hit-or-miss numerical methods. We show that the problem can be solved by a unified approach, quickly and reliably. "

The solution procedure is tested on the buoyancy-driven cavity problem, and results obtained for a range of Rayleigh numbers. We prove that under appropriate conditions, the continuation strategy will converge to the true solution. The proof requires the assumption of the existence and uniqueness of solutions at each Rayleigh number; however, we finally prove the existence of weak solutions of the underlying continuous problem and give a sufficient condition for uniqueness of the solution.

abstract = "Mathematical models of technological systems at steady state are generally represented by a set of equations, say F(z)=0 where zϵU is a vector variable taking its values in region U and F is a vector of functions. The equations may not determine a unique solution, but only a submanifold \{UF\} of a vector space; they are then regarded as a set of constraints due to certain model hypotheses adopted. If the values of certain variables (say x) have been measured, we decompose z=(y,x). Because of possible errors of measurement, it can happen that (y,x)∉UF whatever y is. The problem of reconciliation consists of finding an adjustment of x, thus some x̂ “as close as possible” to x and such that (y,x̂)ϵUF for some y. Using a norm (derived in practice from the covariance matrix of measurement errors), we have to minimize ||x̂-x||. Instead of the classical method of Lagrange multipliers, an approximative method is proposed that is based on a sequence of linearized solutions; the method requires only the evaluation of the Jacobi matrix in each step. Under precisely formulated conditions, the convergence of the successive approximations is proved. The method can also be considered a generalization of Newton's method where matrix inversion is replaced by matrix pseudoinversion (generalized inversion) satisfying the minimum norm condition. "

abstract = "Stiff initial-value \{ODE\} methods (e.g. BDF) normally require the Jacobian matrix as part of a Newton-like iteration within each implicit time step, and require it to be formed and stored explicitly, whether the linear algebraic method used is direct or iterative. But, a Krylov subspace iterative linear system method, which involves the system matrix only in operator form, can be made part of an inexact Newton method within such a stiff \{ODE\} method in a matrix-free manner, requiring no explicit Jacobian matrix storage. Such combinations, using \{BDF\} methods, have been implemented with Arnoldi iteration, \{GMRES\} (the Generalized Minimum \{RESidual\} method), and \{CG\} (the Conjugate Gradient Method). Various practical matters (scaling, starting, stopping, etc.) are dealt with in the stiff \{ODE\} context. In the context of general nonlinear algebraic systems, we provide some theoretical foundation for the combined Newton-Krylov method by giving convergence results that include errors due to the difference quotient approximation to the linear operator. Earlier tests showed matrix-free methods to be quite effective, at least when the spectrum of the kproblem Jacobian is rather tightly clustered. To improve their robustness, we have added preconditioning, in an experimental solver called LSODPK, which we tested on \{ODE\} systems that arise from time-dependent \{PDE\} systems by the method of lines. Preconditioner matrices can be formed from the interaction or reaction terms, from the spatial transport terms, or both (as in operator splitting). The additional matrix storage can be reduced greatly by grouping the diagonal blocks in a natural way. The methods appear to be quite effective in improving both speed and storage economy over traditional stiff methods, and over matrix-free methods without preconditioning. "
