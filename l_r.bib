abstract = {A method for the calculation of one-electron two-center integrals is described. Using an ellipsoidal coordinate system, both the overlap, kinetic energy, and nuclear attraction integrals are expressed in terms of the so-called sigma function introduced by Baba-Ahmed et al. [A. Baba-Ahmed and J. Gayoso, Int. J. Quant. Chem. 23, 71 (1983), Eq. (51)] and which is easily programmed for a computer. The present investigation offers an advantage in that general formulas are derived which facilitate computation of the overlap and related two-center integrals over all Slater-type orbitals (STOs) with eventual nonintegral values of the principal quantum number. The proposed algorithm permits to avoid the procedure of interpolation [A. Baba-Ahmed and J. Gayoso, Theor. Chim. Acta, 62, 507 (1983), Eqs. 11–14] used to overcome the difficulty introduced by the presence of nonintegral quantum numbers. Finally, numerical aspects of the proposed algorithm are analyzed and comparisons with other approaches are given. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Int J Quant Chem 63: 843–852, 1997},

In this article, the WEC iteration method is applied to the calculation of the ground state and of some excited states of a quartic anharmonic oscillator, i.e., a Boson system, using a large reference space, as well as of the H2O molecule, i.e., a Fermion system. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

However, the wave-function expansion coefficient (WECs), which are certain matrix elements of the wave operator, are determined by an iterative method. For these WECs, we deduced new nonlinear equations utilizing the concept of a reference space and the generalized Bloch equation for the wave operator. To test these equations, the method is used to calculate with great accuracy the energy eigenvalues of the ground state and first few excited states of the quartic anharmonic oscillator, whose Rayleigh-Schrödinger perturbation series diverges strongly for every nonzero coupling constant. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.},

The convergence of the method is tested for two-center overlap, nuclear attraction, and two-electron one-center integrals, due to the scarcity of the literature, and fair uniform convergence and great numerical stability under wide changes in molecular parameters is achieved. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Two-center overlap integrals are expressed as finite sum of Gaunt coefficients and auxiliary functions S Ln,n′(p, t). Special attention is paid to the efficient calculation of this auxiliary function by introducing analytic and recurrence relations. In order to test the accuracy of the formula for two-center overlap integrals, we performed an extensive study in which quantum numbers, orbital exponents, and internuclear distances were varied over wide ranges. We found that the method presented here for two-center overlap integrals is fully reliable for very high quantum numbers and the computation times are very low. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Our approach leads to considerable simplification of the derivation of analytical representations for the overlap integrals over Slater type orbitals. In this approach, the representations of overlap integrals with both the same and different screening parameters have been obtained with the help of the Rayleigh expansion of a plane wave in terms of spherical Bessel functions and spherical harmonics. Analytical expressions obtained by this method have been expressed in terms of Gaunt coefficients, which are the product of spherical harmonics, Gegenbauer, and binomial coefficients. These overlap integrals have also been calculated with respect to the differences in n1 − l1 and n2 − l2 numbers that are even or odd. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Int J Quantum Chem, 2004},

                   employed to evaluate one-center correlated three-electron
                   integrals is converted into a different form. The alternative
                   expression obtained allows convergence accelerator techniques
                   to be directly applied in a very effective manner. The
                   resulting expansion is found to be numerically stable, in
                   contrast to the series obtained when convergence accelerator
                   techniques are applied to the standard expansion. Using this
                   approach, the increase in computational speed is found to be
                   very significant for the most slowly converging integrals.

abstract = {Gaunt coefficients express angular momentum conservation rules. They are therefore required in the combination of atomic orbitals. In this case, the angular factors are spherical harmonics and the Gaunt coefficients appear when their products are linearized. The Gaunt coefficients may be pre-calculated and stored. This work describes new index functions for storing and retrieving the required Gaunt coefficients that are (almost) all nonzero. This strategy is closely related to that of Rasch and Yu, who have compared retrieval to that using recurrence relations and found it to be at least 20 times faster. Some improvements to their work will be found here and the index functions used are different. Only a few arithmetic operations are required to generate the index; therefore, its evaluation and handling takes a negligible time compared to its applications, notably molecular electronic integral evaluation. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

These functions are generally chosen because of their compact Fourier transform, following Shavitt. The inverse Laplace transform in the square root of the variable is used for Gauss quadrature in this work. Two procedures for obtaining accurate gaussian expansions have been compared for the required extended precision arithmetic. The first is based on Gaussian quadratures and the second on direct optimization. Both use the Maple computer algebra system. Numerical results are tabulated and compared with previous work. Special cases are found to agree before pushing the optimization technique further. The optimal gaussian expansions of B functions obtained in this work are available for reference. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Int J Quantum Chem, 2009},
