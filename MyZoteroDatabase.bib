	abstract = {We propose efficient preconditioning algorithms for an eigenvalue problem arising in quantum physics, namely, the computation of a few interior eigenvalues and their associated eigenvectors for large-scale sparse real and symmetric indefinite matrices of the Anderson model of localization. We compare the Lanczos algorithm in the 1987 implementation by Cullum and Willoughby with the shift-and-invert techniques in the implicitly restarted Lanczos method and in the Jacobi-Davidson method. Our preconditioning approaches for the shift-and-invert symmetric indefinite linear system are based on maximum weighted matchings and algebraic multilevel incomplete $^{\textrm{T\$}}$ factorizations. These techniques can be seen as a complement to the alternative idea of using more complete pivoting techniques for the highly ill-conditioned symmetric indefinite Anderson matrices. We demonstrate the effectiveness and the numerical accuracy of these algorithms. Our numerical examples reveal that recent algebraic multilevel preconditioning solvers can accelerate the computation of a large-scale eigenvalue problem corresponding to the Anderson model of localization by several orders of magnitude.},

Our approach leads to considerable simplification of the derivation of analytical representations for the overlap integrals over Slater type orbitals. In this approach, the representations of overlap integrals with both the same and different screening parameters have been obtained with the help of the Rayleigh expansion of a plane wave in terms of spherical Bessel functions and spherical harmonics. Analytical expressions obtained by this method have been expressed in terms of Gaunt coefficients, which are the product of spherical harmonics, Gegenbauer, and binomial coefficients. These overlap integrals have also been calculated with respect to the differences in n1 − l1 and n2 − l2 numbers that are even or odd. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Int J Quantum Chem, 2004},

In order to test the accuracy of the formula for two-center overlap integrals, we performed an extensive study in which quantum numbers, orbital exponents, and internuclear distances were varied over wide ranges. We found that the method presented here for two-center overlap integrals is fully reliable for very high quantum numbers and the computation times are very low. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The convergence of the method is tested for two-center overlap, nuclear attraction, and two-electron one-center integrals, due to the scarcity of the literature, and fair uniform convergence and great numerical stability under wide changes in molecular parameters is achieved. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The modification is performed by taking an interpolating polynomial to replace either f ( z n ) or f ′ ( z n ) . In six of the eight methods we have used a Hermite interpolating polynomial. The other two schemes use inverse interpolation. We discovered that the eighth order methods based on Jarratt’s optimal fourth order methods perform well and those based on King’s or Kung–Traub’s methods do not. In all cases tested, the replacement of f ( z ) by Hermite interpolation is better than the replacement of the derivative, f ′ ( z ) .},

The methods are usually compared by evaluating the computational efficiency and the efficiency index. In this paper all the methods have the same efficiency, since they are of the same order and use the same information. Frequently, comparisons of the various schemes are based on the number of iterations required for convergence, number of function evaluations, and/or amount of \{CPU\} time. If a particular algorithm does not converge or if it converges to a different solution, then that particular algorithm is thought to be inferior to the others. The primary flaw in this type of comparison is that the starting point represents only one of an infinite number of other choices. Here we use the basin of attraction idea to recommend the best fourth order method. The basin of attraction is a method to visually comprehend how an algorithm behaves as a function of the various starting points.},

	abstract = {Singlet–triplet transition moments and phosphorescence lifetimes have been calculated for the three-atomic molecules HCN, O3, H2O, H2S, GeF2, GeCl2 and GeBr2 by time-dependent density functional theory (DFT) utilizing quadratic response functions in order to qualify DFT which recently has become available for studies of this kind [TUNELL, I., Rinkevivius, Z., VAHTRAS, O., SALEK, P., HELGAKER, T., and ÅGREN, H., 2003, J. chem. phys., 119, 11024]. Comparison with ab initio and experimental data indicates that DFT exhibit results of similar quality as explicitly correlated methods which indicates that it indeed is a viable approach for singlet–triplet transitions. O3 provides an intriguing example in that a systematic investigation of the singlet–triplet transition moment of its Wulf band indicates a clear advantage of the DFT technique despite the multiconfigurational character of the electronic structure of this molecule. The electronic spin–spin coupling and the hyperfine nuclear coupling constants have also been calculated in order to further characterize the triplet state in the spectra of the investigated systems.},

	abstract = {In this work, Slater-type atomic orbitals (STOs) are expanded over B functions to exploit the compact Fourier transform of these functions. The analytic representations of three-center nuclear attraction integrals and multicenter bielectronic integrals over B functions involve semiinfinite highly oscillatory integrals, which can be transformed into infinite series. These integrals must be evaluated precisely and quickly. This work describes an efficient method for the evaluation of these integrals based on the nonlinear SD transformation, recently developed by Safouhi. The SD method was applied to multicenter integrals over B functions, and it is shown that this method is highly efficient compared with alternatives previously used. The SD approach should lead to a definitive suite of ab initio Slater software. The convergence properties were analyzed and they showed that the approximations obtained using the SD approach converge to the exact values of the semiinfinite integrals without any constraint. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {In this study, detailed spectroscopic investigations of the blue emitting compounds Ir(4,6-dFppy)2(pic) and Pt(4,6- dFppy)(acac) are presented. Due to spin-orbit coupling (SOC) of the emitting triplet state with higher lying singlet states both complexes show an intense phosphorescence and are utilized as emitters in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). Distinct differences with respect to important photophysical properties are found for the two compounds. For example, the (distorted) octahedral Ir(4,6-dFppy)2(pic) complex exhibits a shorter emission decay time and shows a larger zero-field splitting (ZFS) than the (distorted) square planar Pt(4,6-dFppy)(acac) complex (t(Ir)=0.4 ?s and t(Pt)=3.6 ?s of the respective shortest-lifed triplet substate; ?(ZFS, Ir)=67 cm-1, ?E(ZFS, Pt)=8 cm-1). This behaviour is connected with the extent of metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT, dp*) character in the emitting triplet state. High MLCT character usually results in a high emission decay rate and indicates a good suitability as OLED emitter material. Of crucial importance in this respect is the effectiveness of SOC. In this study it is shown that the SOC routes depend on the coordination geometry of the emitter compound. In particular, the couplings can be more effective in (distorted) octahedral than in (distorted) square planar compounds. Hence, the photophysical differences of Ir(4,6-dFppy)2(pic) compared to Pt(4,6-dFppy)(acac) can be rationalized. Moreover, this investigation shows that the analysis of SOC paths provides general guidelines for the design of efficient emitters for OLED applications.},

For this end, ground state energies are calculated at the MP4 level for various basis sets of increasing size. With negligible extra effort, the Π2, F4, and [2/2] estimators are obtained, together with information on the reliability of the basic perturbation series [1]. The results are compared to more expensive CCSD(T) results. Also, electronic energy hypersurfaces are calculated at these levels. As a further possibility to test the performance of the method, vibrational frequencies and other spectroscopic constants of diatomic molecules are calculated by fitting different analytic functions to the hypersurfaces obtained by different methods and compared to experimental data.[1] H.

	abstract = {In dieser Arbeit werden analytische Darstellungen und numerische Verfahren zur Berechnung der im Rahmen von nicht-relativistischen LCAO-MO-SCF-Rechnungen auftretenden Molekülintegrale für eine spezielle Klasse exponentialartiger Funktionen untersucht. Bei den Funktionen handelt es sich um die sogenannten B-Funktionen, die durch eine besonders einfache Fourier-Transformierte und eine sehr einfache Laplace-Darstellung ausgezeichnet sind. Damit sind B-Funktionen unter den exponentialartigen Funktionen prädestiniert für die Anwendung der Fourier-Transformationsmethode. Der skalare Anteil der B-Funktionen ist im wesentlichen durch eine reduzierte Bessel-Funktion gegeben. Bei diesen Untersuchungen werden Integraltransformationsmethoden zugrundegelegt. Dazu gehören die bereits genannte Fourier-Transformationsmethode und die Bessel-Transformationsmethode, die auf einer neuentdeckten, eindimensionalen Integraldarstellung für das Produkt zweier beliebiger reduzierter Bessel-Funktionen beruht, aus der eindimensionale Integraldarstellungen für zweizentrige Dichten zweier B-Funktionen hergeleitet werden. Diese zweizentrigen Dichten und ihre Fourier-Transformierten kann man aber als wesentlichen Baustein von mehrzentrigen Molekülintegralen mit B-Funktionen auffassen. Die Verwendung dieser Transformationsmethoden erlaubt folgerichtig die Herleitung einer Reihe von neuen Darstellungen für Molekülintegrale mit B-Funktionen. Numerisch werden vor allem Integraldarstellungen für Molekülintegrale mit B-Funktionen untersucht, die man mit der Fourier-Transformationsmethode herleiten kann. Für die numerische Auswertung dieser Integraldarstellungen werden neue Quadraturverfahren eingeführt. Besondere Berücksichtigung dabei findet der Fall stark unterschiedlicher Exponentialparameter, für den herkömmliche Methoden Schwierigkeiten haben. Durch eingehende Analyse wird als Grund dieser Schwierigkeiten das Auftreten von bestimmten Gewichtsfunktionen festgestellt. Diese Gewichtsfunktionen verursachen scharfe Spitzen, die die numerische Quadratur stark erschweren. Dieses Problem wird gelöst mit Hilfe von speziellen Koordinatentransformationen, den Möbius-Transformationen, und den darauf aufbauenden, neuen Quadraturverfahren. - Abschnitt 1: Einleitung (Quantenchemische Näherungsverfahren, Übersicht über die Arbeit und Abgrenzung des Themas) Abschnitt 2: Zusammenstellung wichtiger Definitionen und Bezeichnungen Abschnitt 3: Allgemeine Eigenschaften von B-Funktionen und Produkten von B-Funktionen Abschnitt 4: Integraltransformationsmethoden zur Behandlung von Molekülintegralen mit B-Funktionen Abschnitt 5: Numerische Quadraturverfahren bei Molekülintegralen mit B-Funktionen Abschnitt 6: Ein-Elektron-Integrale bei B-Funktionen: Fourier-Transformierte von Produkten zweier B-Funktionen, Überlappungsintegrale und verwandte Integrale Abschnitt 7: Ein-Elektron-Integrale mit B-Funktionen: Kernanziehungsintegrale Abschnitt 8: Zwei-Elektronen-Integrale mit B-Funktionen Anhang A: Einige Details über reduzierte Bessel-Funktionen Anhang B: Einige Grö{\textbackslash}s sen mit Bezug zur Kugeldrehgruppe Anhang C: Programmtechnische Details Anhang D: Zweizentrige Produkte zweier B-Funktionen: Rekursionen Anhang E: Umrechnung von Laguerre-Regeln Anhang F: Zur Implementierung der Regel W\$”\$ Anhang G: Eigenschaften der Sigma-Funktionen},

	abstract = {We propose efficient preconditioning algorithms for an eigenvalue problem arising in quantum physics, namely, the computation of a few interior eigenvalues and their associated eigenvectors for large-scale sparse real and symmetric indefinite matrices of the Anderson model of localization. We compare the Lanczos algorithm in the 1987 implementation by Cullum and Willoughby with the shift-and-invert techniques in the implicitly restarted Lanczos method and in the Jacobi-Davidson method. Our preconditioning approaches for the shift-and-invert symmetric indefinite linear system are based on maximum weighted matchings and algebraic multilevel incomplete $^{\textrm{T\$}}$ factorizations. These techniques can be seen as a complement to the alternative idea of using more complete pivoting techniques for the highly ill-conditioned symmetric indefinite Anderson matrices. We demonstrate the effectiveness and the numerical accuracy of these algorithms. Our numerical examples reveal that recent algebraic multilevel preconditioning solvers can accelerate the computation of a large-scale eigenvalue problem corresponding to the Anderson model of localization by several orders of magnitude.},

	abstract = {We develop a new type of derivative matrix for pseudospectral methods. The norm of these matrices grows at the optimal rate O(N**2) for N-by-N matrices, in contrast to standard pseudospectral constructions that result in O(N**4) growth of the norm. The smaller norm has a big advantage when using the derivative matrix for solving time dependent problems such as wave propagation. The construction is based on representing the derivative operator as an integral kernel, and does not rely on the interpolating polynomials. In particular, we construct second derivative matrices that incorporate Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions on an interval and on the disk, but the method can be used to construct a wide variety of commonly used operators for solving \{PDEs\} and integral equations. The construction can be used with any quadrature, including traditional Gauss�Legendre quadratures, but we have found that by using quadratures based on prolate spheroidal wave functions, we can achieve a near optimal sampling rate close to two points per wavelength, even for non-periodic problems. We provide numerical results for the new construction and demonstrate that the construction achieves similar or better accuracy than traditional pseudospectral derivative matrices, while resulting in a norm that is orders of magnitude smaller than the standard construction. To demonstrate the advantage of the new construction, we apply the method for solving the wave equation in constant and discontinuous media and for solving \{PDEs\} on the unit disk. We also present two compression algorithms for applying the derivative matrices in O(N\&\#xa0;log\&\#xa0;N) operations.},

In the particular case where the terms of the sequence to be transformed are the partial sums of a formal power series, this transformation leads to Padé-type approximants. Then, using various operators, some extensions of Drummond's process are proposed, and their properties are given. A new expression for the E-transformation, using generalized divided differences, is obtained, and it is also generalized. The recurrence relation for these differences can be used for its implementation, and the Ford–Sidi algorithm is also related to them.

With the process developed, we can obtain n-step derivative free iterative methods with memory of arbitrary high order. Numerical examples are provided to show that the new methods have an equal or superior performance, on smooth and nonsmooth equations, compared to classical iterative methods as Steffensen's and Newton's methods and other derivative free methods with and without memory with high order of convergence.},

	abstract = {As a first application of the shift operators method we derive master formulas for the two- and three-center one-electron integrals involving Gaussians, Slater, and Bessel basis functions. All these formulas have a common structure consisting in linear combinations of polynomials of differences of nuclear coordinates. Whereas the polynomials are independent of the type (GTO, BTO, or STO) of basis functions, the coefficients depend on both the class of integral (overlap, kinetic energy, nuclear attraction) and the type of basis functions. We present the general expression of polynomials and coefficients as well as the recurrence relations for both the polynomials and the whole integrals. Finally, we remark on the formal and computational advantages of this approach. © 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc. Int J Quant Chem 78: 83–93, 2000},

	abstract = {Laplace transform is a powerful method for enabling solving differential equation in engineering and science. Using the Laplace transform for solving differential equations, however, sometimes leads to solutions in the Laplace domain that are not readily invertible to the real domain by analytical means. Numerical inversion methods are then used to convert the obtained solution from the Laplace domain into the real domain. Four inversion methods are evaluated in this paper. Several test functions, which arise in engineering applications, are used to evaluate the inversion methods. We also show that each of the inversion methods is accurate for a particular case. This study shows that among all these methods, the Fourier transform inversion technique is the most powerful but also the most computationally expensive. Stehfest’s method, which is used in many engineering applications is easy to implement and leads to accurate results for many problems including diffusion-dominated ones and solutions that behave like e−t type functions. However, this method fails to predict et type functions or those with an oscillatory response, such as sine and wave functions.},

An accurate and efficient spectral tau technique for solving the fractional diffusion equations numerically is proposed. This method is based upon Chebyshev tau approximation together with Chebyshev operational matrix of Caputo fractional differentiation. Such approach has the advantage of reducing the problem to the solution of a system of algebraic equations, which may then be solved by any standard numerical technique. We apply this general method to solve four specific examples. In each of the examples considered, the numerical results show that the proposed method is of high accuracy and is efficient for solving the time-dependent fractional diffusion equations.},

	abstract = {A divergent perturbation series is known to yield very unreliable results for observables even at moderate coupling strengths. One of the most popular techniques in handling such series is to express them as rational functions, but it is often faithful only for small coupling. We outline here how one can gain considerable advantages in the large-coupling regime by properly embedding known asymptotic scaling relations for selected observables during construction of the aforesaid Padé approximants. Three new bypass routes are explored in this context. The first approach involves a weighted geometric mean of two neighboring PA. The second idea is to consider series for specific ratios of observables. The third strategy is to express observables as functionals of the total energy in the form of series expansions. Symanzik's scaling relation, and the virial and Hellmann–Feynman theorems, are used at appropriate places to aid each of the strategies. Pilot calculations on the ground-state perturbation series of certain observables for the quartic anharmonic oscillator problem reveal readily the benefit and novelty. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

This �complex-plane� MWA, effected via a linear-path detour in the complex plane, results in rapid, absolute convergence of field and potential solutions in multi-layered environments regardless of the source-observer geometry and anisotropy/loss of the media present. In this work, we first introduce a new integration path used to evaluate the field contribution arising from the radiation spectra. Subsequently, we (1) exhibit the foundational relations behind the complex-plane extension to a general Levin-type sequence convergence accelerator, (2) specialize this analysis to one member of the Levin transform family (the MWA), (3) address and circumvent restrictions, arising for two-dimensional integrals associated with wave dynamics problems, through minimal complex-plane detour restrictions and a novel partition of the integration domain, (4) develop and compare two formulations based on standard/real-axis \{MWA\} variants, and (5) present validation results and convergence characteristics for one of these two formulations.},

Efficient evaluation of three-center nuclear attraction integrals over STOs to predetermined accuracy is made possible by applying the nonlinear D and D transformations.

This work shows how the conditions of applicability for these transformations are readily proven to be satisfied using the Axiom symbolic computation system. Axiom also provides exact values of the integrals for comparison. Their evaluation by standard numerical quadrature methods (Gauss–Laguerre), proves inadequate: Certain parameters lead to inaccurate values for the integrals, whereas the transformed integrals are highly accurate and rapidly evaluated. © 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

	abstract = {The present work focuses on the recent progress in nonlinear transformation methods for improving the convergence of highly oscillatory integrals and in their applications for an efficient and rapid numerical evaluation of molecular electronic integrals over Slater-type functions (STFs). The nonlinear D transformation, which is probably the most effective general approach for increasing the rate of convergence of semi-infinite oscillatory integrals, is presented. Molecular integrals over STFs are expressed as finite linear combinations of integrals over B functions. The basis set of B functions is suitable to apply the Fourier transform method, which led to analytic expressions, involving highly oscillatory functions, for molecular integrals. Efficient algorithms based on the D transformation are now developed for a numerical evaluation of molecular integrals over STFs. Numerical results that we obtained with linear and nonlinear molecules, and which are in agreement with those obtained using existing codes (Alchemy, STOP, and ADGGSTNGINT), show that the algorithms described in this work are relevant. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This approximation is called multivariate perturbed Padé approximation. The error of the introduced approximation vanishes at some points in the square \$[0, 0.5]{\textasciicircum}2\$. A comparison of the results obtained by our introduced approximation and the well-known Canterbury Approximation (proposed by J. Chisholm and his colleagues) is given.},

	abstract = {Now ab initio or density functional theory (DFT) molecular property calculations over a Slater-type orbital basis are available in several software packages. In this work, the relative merits of various exponential-type orbitals (ETOs) are investigated for solving problems of interest to nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), while showing how they are related mathematically. The preferred ETOs will be shown to be the hydrogenic orbitals and similar Coulomb Sturmians. Slater-type functions (STFs) will be compared with them, and suitable equivalent (seldom used) combinations given. The correct shielding of the nucleus, resulting from radial factors of hydrogenic orbitals, is finally shown to be essential in the evaluation of precise nuclear shielding tensors for NMR spectroscopy of molecules using ab initio or DFT methods. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {Performing quantum chemical integral evaluation directly, without recursion and without direct coupling of angular momenta according to the rotation group is analyzed. The rotation group limits the structure of these closed-form expressions. The result of all cross differentiation is a rotational invariant. Closed-form expressions are obtained for the general three- and four-center Gaussian integral. The solid harmonic addition formula can be used to express these integrals as sums of products of an exponent-independent (angular) factor and a molecular-orientation-independent (exponential) factor in a variety of ways. The results are products of two such factors summed over the set of distinct, relevant polynomials of the exponents. The coefficients of these polynomials, angular factors, are complicated but common to all n-center matrix elements and independent of any type of contraction. Derivatives must be obtained using the product rule. An implementation in the Solid Spherical Harmonic Gaussian (SSHG) computer code is outlined and preliminary comparison is made. © 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc. Int J Quant Chem 81: 373–383, 2001},

	abstract = {"Let F(z) be a vector-valued function, F: C - CN, which is analytic at z=0 and meromorphic in a neighbourhood of z=0, and let its Maclaurin series be given. In this work we develop vector-valued rational approximation procedures for F(z) by applying vector extrapolation methods to the sequence of partial sums of its Maclaurin series. We analyze some of the algebraic and analytic properties of the rational approximations thus obtained and show that they are akin to Pad� approximants. In particular, we prove a Koenig-type theorem concerning their poles and a de Montessus-type theorem concerning their uniform convergence. We show how "optimal" approximations to multiple poles and to Laurent expansions about these poles can be constructed. Extensions of the procedures above and the accompanying theoretical results to functions defined in arbitrary linear spaces is also considered. One of the most interesting and immediate applications of the results of this work is to the matrix eigenvalue problem. In a new work we exploit the developments of the present work to devise bona fide generalizations of the classical power method that are especially suitable for very large and sparse matrices. These generalizations can be used to approximate simultaneously several of the largest distinct eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors and invariant subspaces of arbitrary matrices, which may or may not be diagonalizable, and are very closely related with known Krylov subspace methods.

Here, we propose to illustrate the feasibility of attacking the problem of the multiple integrations needed entirely by numerical quadratures, in conjunction with a strategic program organization that allows evaluating simultaneously sets of thousands of integrals exploiting the mean characteristics of the integrands. This approach, envisaged and implemented many years ago by two of the present authors (C.G., O.S.), perhaps without adequate exposure, is endowed in our experience with good properties. The program package, which allows dealing on the same footing with linear and nonlinear molecular geometries, has been largely revised by introducing suitable adjustments and improvements (in particular extension to orbitals with azimuthal quantum number l=3). © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The matrix quotients are based on the generalized inverse for a matrix introduced by Gu Chuanqing and Chen Zhibing (1995) which is found to be effective in continued fraction interpolation.

Molecules with a propensity for TADF necessarily have two properties: a small gap between the lowest lying singlet and triplet excited states and a large transition dipole moment for fluorescence. In this work, we demonstrate the use of a genetic algorithm to search a region of chemical space for molecules with these properties. This algorithm is based on a flexible and intuitive representation of the molecule as a tree data structure, in which the nodes correspond to molecular fragments. Our implementation takes advantage of hybrid parallel graphics processing unit accelerated computer clusters to allow efficient sampling while retaining a reasonably accurate description of the electronic structure (in this case, CAM-B3LYP/6-31G**). In total, we have identified 3792 promising candidate fluorophores from a chemical space containing 1.26 � 10**6 molecules. This required performing electronic structure calculations on only 7518 molecules, a small fraction of the full space. Several novel classes of molecules which show promise as fluorophores are presented.},

We present the received new results of the local and semilocal convergence, in case when the first-order divided differences of a nonlinear operator are H�lder continuous. Moreover a quadratic nonlinear majorant for a nonlinear operator, according to the conditions laid upon it, is built. A priori and a posteriori estimations of the method�s error are received. The method needs almost the same number of computations as the classical Secant method, but has a higher order of convergence. We apply our results to the numerical solving of a nonlinear boundary value problem of second-order and to the systems of nonlinear equations of large dimension.},

Our approach is based on vector valued rational approximation where the approximants are determined by the denominator polynomials whose coefficients are obtained by solving an inexpensive linear least-squares problem. No matrix multiplications or divisions but matrix-vector products are required in the whole process. A technique of scaling and recurrence enables our method to be more effective when the problem is for fixed A , b and many values of t . We also give a backward error analysis in exact arithmetic for the truncation errors to derive our new algorithm. Preliminary numerical results illustrate that the new algorithm performs well.},

We used 9,10-bis-(2,2-diphenylvinyl)-anthracene single crystals to produce blue and green light from identical single-crystal transistors. We also observed red light, which corresponds to the emission from in-gap states that are caused by impurities. Importantly, each of these different colors corresponds to a distinguishable light polarization, which enables us to tune the emission color by using a light polarizer.},

	abstract = {In dieser Arbeit werden analytische Darstellungen und numerische Verfahren zur Berechnung der im Rahmen von nicht-relativistischen LCAO-MO-SCF-Rechnungen auftretenden Molekülintegrale für eine spezielle Klasse exponentialartiger Funktionen untersucht. Bei den Funktionen handelt es sich um die sogenannten B-Funktionen, die durch eine besonders einfache Fourier-Transformierte und eine sehr einfache Laplace-Darstellung ausgezeichnet sind. Damit sind B-Funktionen unter den exponentialartigen Funktionen prädestiniert für die Anwendung der Fourier-Transformationsmethode. Der skalare Anteil der B-Funktionen ist im wesentlichen durch eine reduzierte Bessel-Funktion gegeben. Bei diesen Untersuchungen werden Integraltransformationsmethoden zugrundegelegt. Dazu gehören die bereits genannte Fourier-Transformationsmethode und die Bessel-Transformationsmethode, die auf einer neuentdeckten, eindimensionalen Integraldarstellung für das Produkt zweier beliebiger reduzierter Bessel-Funktionen beruht, aus der eindimensionale Integraldarstellungen für zweizentrige Dichten zweier B-Funktionen hergeleitet werden. Diese zweizentrigen Dichten und ihre Fourier-Transformierten kann man aber als wesentlichen Baustein von mehrzentrigen Molekülintegralen mit B-Funktionen auffassen. Die Verwendung dieser Transformationsmethoden erlaubt folgerichtig die Herleitung einer Reihe von neuen Darstellungen für Molekülintegrale mit B-Funktionen. Numerisch werden vor allem Integraldarstellungen für Molekülintegrale mit B-Funktionen untersucht, die man mit der Fourier-Transformationsmethode herleiten kann. Für die numerische Auswertung dieser Integraldarstellungen werden neue Quadraturverfahren eingeführt. Besondere Berücksichtigung dabei findet der Fall stark unterschiedlicher Exponentialparameter, für den herkömmliche Methoden Schwierigkeiten haben. Durch eingehende Analyse wird als Grund dieser Schwierigkeiten das Auftreten von bestimmten Gewichtsfunktionen festgestellt. Diese Gewichtsfunktionen verursachen scharfe Spitzen, die die numerische Quadratur stark erschweren. Dieses Problem wird gelöst mit Hilfe von speziellen Koordinatentransformationen, den Möbius-Transformationen, und den darauf aufbauenden, neuen Quadraturverfahren. - Abschnitt 1: Einleitung (Quantenchemische Näherungsverfahren, Übersicht über die Arbeit und Abgrenzung des Themas) Abschnitt 2: Zusammenstellung wichtiger Definitionen und Bezeichnungen Abschnitt 3: Allgemeine Eigenschaften von B-Funktionen und Produkten von B-Funktionen Abschnitt 4: Integraltransformationsmethoden zur Behandlung von Molekülintegralen mit B-Funktionen Abschnitt 5: Numerische Quadraturverfahren bei Molekülintegralen mit B-Funktionen Abschnitt 6: Ein-Elektron-Integrale bei B-Funktionen: Fourier-Transformierte von Produkten zweier B-Funktionen, Überlappungsintegrale und verwandte Integrale Abschnitt 7: Ein-Elektron-Integrale mit B-Funktionen: Kernanziehungsintegrale Abschnitt 8: Zwei-Elektronen-Integrale mit B-Funktionen Anhang A: Einige Details über reduzierte Bessel-Funktionen Anhang B: Einige Grö{\textbackslash}s sen mit Bezug zur Kugeldrehgruppe Anhang C: Programmtechnische Details Anhang D: Zweizentrige Produkte zweier B-Funktionen: Rekursionen Anhang E: Umrechnung von Laguerre-Regeln Anhang F: Zur Implementierung der Regel W\$”\$ Anhang G: Eigenschaften der Sigma-Funktionen},

The remainder formula is developed and an algorithm for the numerator polynomials is presented when the generating polynomials are given in advance. By means of the Hankel-like coefficient matrix, a determinantal expression of B M P T A is presented. Moreover, to avoid the computation of the determinants, two efficient recursive algorithms are proposed.

	abstract = {In dieser Arbeit werden analytische Darstellungen und numerische Verfahren zur Berechnung der im Rahmen von nicht-relativistischen LCAO-MO-SCF-Rechnungen auftretenden Molekülintegrale für eine spezielle Klasse exponentialartiger Funktionen untersucht. Bei den Funktionen handelt es sich um die sogenannten B-Funktionen, die durch eine besonders einfache Fourier-Transformierte und eine sehr einfache Laplace-Darstellung ausgezeichnet sind. Damit sind B-Funktionen unter den exponentialartigen Funktionen prädestiniert für die Anwendung der Fourier-Transformationsmethode. Der skalare Anteil der B-Funktionen ist im wesentlichen durch eine reduzierte Bessel-Funktion gegeben. Bei diesen Untersuchungen werden Integraltransformationsmethoden zugrundegelegt. Dazu gehören die bereits genannte Fourier-Transformationsmethode und die Bessel-Transformationsmethode, die auf einer neuentdeckten, eindimensionalen Integraldarstellung für das Produkt zweier beliebiger reduzierter Bessel-Funktionen beruht, aus der eindimensionale Integraldarstellungen für zweizentrige Dichten zweier B-Funktionen hergeleitet werden. Diese zweizentrigen Dichten und ihre Fourier-Transformierten kann man aber als wesentlichen Baustein von mehrzentrigen Molekülintegralen mit B-Funktionen auffassen. Die Verwendung dieser Transformationsmethoden erlaubt folgerichtig die Herleitung einer Reihe von neuen Darstellungen für Molekülintegrale mit B-Funktionen. Numerisch werden vor allem Integraldarstellungen für Molekülintegrale mit B-Funktionen untersucht, die man mit der Fourier-Transformationsmethode herleiten kann. Für die numerische Auswertung dieser Integraldarstellungen werden neue Quadraturverfahren eingeführt. Besondere Berücksichtigung dabei findet der Fall stark unterschiedlicher Exponentialparameter, für den herkömmliche Methoden Schwierigkeiten haben. Durch eingehende Analyse wird als Grund dieser Schwierigkeiten das Auftreten von bestimmten Gewichtsfunktionen festgestellt. Diese Gewichtsfunktionen verursachen scharfe Spitzen, die die numerische Quadratur stark erschweren. Dieses Problem wird gelöst mit Hilfe von speziellen Koordinatentransformationen, den Möbius-Transformationen, und den darauf aufbauenden, neuen Quadraturverfahren. - Abschnitt 1: Einleitung (Quantenchemische Näherungsverfahren, Übersicht über die Arbeit und Abgrenzung des Themas) Abschnitt 2: Zusammenstellung wichtiger Definitionen und Bezeichnungen Abschnitt 3: Allgemeine Eigenschaften von B-Funktionen und Produkten von B-Funktionen Abschnitt 4: Integraltransformationsmethoden zur Behandlung von Molekülintegralen mit B-Funktionen Abschnitt 5: Numerische Quadraturverfahren bei Molekülintegralen mit B-Funktionen Abschnitt 6: Ein-Elektron-Integrale bei B-Funktionen: Fourier-Transformierte von Produkten zweier B-Funktionen, Überlappungsintegrale und verwandte Integrale Abschnitt 7: Ein-Elektron-Integrale mit B-Funktionen: Kernanziehungsintegrale Abschnitt 8: Zwei-Elektronen-Integrale mit B-Funktionen Anhang A: Einige Details über reduzierte Bessel-Funktionen Anhang B: Einige Grö{\textbackslash}s sen mit Bezug zur Kugeldrehgruppe Anhang C: Programmtechnische Details Anhang D: Zweizentrige Produkte zweier B-Funktionen: Rekursionen Anhang E: Umrechnung von Laguerre-Regeln Anhang F: Zur Implementierung der Regel W\$”\$ Anhang G: Eigenschaften der Sigma-Funktionen},

They allow the user to either numerically approximate multi-valued functions represented by a formal series expansion or to compute explicit approximants for them. The approximation scheme is based on Hermite�Pad� polynomials and includes both Pad� and algebraic approximants as limiting cases. The algorithm for the computation of the Hermite�Pad� polynomials is based on a set of recursive equations which were derived from a generalization of continued fractions. The approximations retain their validity even on the cuts of the complex Riemann surface which allows for example the calculation of resonances in quantum mechanical problems. The programs also allow for the construction of multi-series approximations which can be more powerful than most summation methods.

These functions can be numerically approximated by summation methods even if the corresponding series is only asymptotic. With the help of Hermite�Pad�-approximants many different approximation schemes can be realized. Pad� and algebraic approximants are just well-known examples. Hermite�Pad�-approximants combine the advantages of highly accurate numerical results with the additional advantage of being able to sum complex multi-valued functions. Method of solution: Special type Hermite�Pad� polynomials are calculated for a set of divergent series. These polynomials are then used to implicitly define approximants for one of the functions of this set. This approximant can be numerically evaluated at any point of the Riemann surface of this function. For an approximation order not greater than 3 the approximants can alternatively be expressed in closed form and then be used to approximate the desired function on its complete Riemann surface. Restriction on the complexity of the problem: In principle, the algorithm is only limited by the available memory and speed of the underlying computer system. Furthermore the achievable accuracy of the approximation only depends on the number of known series coefficients of the function to be approximated assuming of course that these coefficients are known with enough accuracy. Typical running time: 10 minutes with parameters comparable to the testruns Unusual features of the program: none},

Because the molecular multicenter integrals of the much simpler Slater-type functions are notoriously difficult, it is not at all obvious why B functions should offer any advantages. However, B functions have Fourier transforms of exceptional simplicity, which greatly simplifies many of their molecular multicenter integrals. This article discusses the historical development of B functions from the perspective of the interaction between mathematics and theoretical chemistry, which traditionally has not been very good. Nevertheless, future progress in theoretical chemistry depends very much on a fertile interaction with neighboring disciplines. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Int J Quantum Chem, 2009},

	abstract = {Addition theorems can be constructed by doing three-dimensional Taylor expansions according to f(r+r′)=exp (r′⋅∇)f(r). Since, however, one is normally interested in addition theorems of irreducible spherical tensors, the application of the translation operator in its Cartesian form exp (x′∂/∂x)exp (y′∂/∂y)exp (z′∂/∂z) would lead to enormous technical problems. A better alternative consists in using a series expansion for the translation operator exp (r′⋅∇) involving powers of the Laplacian ∇2 and spherical tensor gradient operators {\textbackslash}documentclassarticle{\textbackslash}pagestyleempty{\textbackslash}begindocument\${\textbackslash}mathcalY{\textasciicircum}m\_{\textbackslash}ell({\textbackslash}nabla)\${\textbackslash}enddocument, which are irreducible spherical tensors of ranks zero and ℓ, respectively (Santos, F. D. Nucl Phys A 1973, 212, 341). In this way, it is indeed possible to derive addition theorems by doing three-dimensional Taylor expansions (Weniger, E. J. Int J Quantum Chem 2000, 76, 280). The application of the translation operator in its spherical form is particularly simple in the case of B functions and leads to an addition theorem with a comparatively compact structure. Since other exponentially decaying functions like Slater-type functions, bound-state hydrogenic eigenfunctions, and other functions based on generalized Laguerre polynomials can be expressed by simple finite sums of B functions, the addition theorems for these functions can be written down immediately. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {A principal tool for the construction of the addition theorem of a function f is the translation operator er′⋅∇, which generates f(r+r′) by doing a three-dimensional Taylor expansion of f around r. In atomic and molecular quantum mechanics, one is usually interested in irreducible spherical tensors. In such a case, the application of the translation operator in its Cartesian form ex′∂/∂xey′∂/∂yez′∂/∂z leads to serious technical problems. A much more promising approach consists of the use of an operator expansion for er′⋅∇ which contains exclusively irreducible spherical tensors. This expansion contains as differential operators the Laplacian ∇2 and the spherical tensor gradient operator 𝒴 lm(∇), which is an irreducible spherical tensor of rank l. Thus, if 𝒴 lm(∇) is applied to another spherical tensor, the angular part of the resulting expression is completely determined by angular momentum coupling, whereas the radial part is obtained by differentiating the radial part of the spherical tensor with respect to r. Consequently, the systematic use of the spherical tensor gradient operator leads to a considerable technical simplification. In this way, the originally three-dimensional expansion problem in x, y, and z is reduced to an essentially one-dimensional expansion problem in r. The practical usefulness of this approach is demonstrated by constructing the Laplace expansion of the Coulomb potential as well as the addition theorems of the regular and irregular solid harmonics and of the Yukawa potential. © 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

For this end, ground state energies are calculated at the MP4 level for various basis sets of increasing size. With negligible extra effort, the Π2, F4, and [2/2] estimators are obtained, together with information on the reliability of the basic perturbation series [1]. The results are compared to more expensive CCSD(T) results. Also, electronic energy hypersurfaces are calculated at these levels. As a further possibility to test the performance of the method, vibrational frequencies and other spectroscopic constants of diatomic molecules are calculated by fitting different analytic functions to the hypersurfaces obtained by different methods and compared to experimental data.[1] H.

To test these equations, the method is used to calculate with great accuracy the energy eigenvalues of the ground state and first few excited states of the quartic anharmonic oscillator, whose Rayleigh-Schrödinger perturbation series diverges strongly for every nonzero coupling constant. © 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

Using an ellipsoidal coordinate system, both the overlap, kinetic energy, and nuclear attraction integrals are expressed in terms of the so-called sigma function introduced by Baba-Ahmed et al. [A. Baba-Ahmed and J. Gayoso, Int. J. Quant. Chem. 23, 71 (1983), Eq. (51)] and which is easily programmed for a computer. The present investigation offers an advantage in that general formulas are derived which facilitate computation of the overlap and related two-center integrals over all Slater-type orbitals (STOs) with eventual nonintegral values of the principal quantum number. The proposed algorithm permits to avoid the procedure of interpolation [A. Baba-Ahmed and J. Gayoso, Theor. Chim. Acta, 62, 507 (1983), Eqs. 11–14] used to overcome the difficulty introduced by the presence of nonintegral quantum numbers.

Total energies computed with the use of the coupled cluster electron correlation technique CCSD(T) were extrapolated to the complete basis set limit with account for spin–orbit, scalar relativistic, and core–valence correlation corrections.},

Two methods for implementing the LSC-IVR/classical Wigner which are in principle feasible to be combined with general force fields or even ab initio electronic structure methods have been reviewed. One is the local Gaussian approximation with the imaginary time path integral approach, the other is the quantum thermal bath method.

Two procedures for obtaining accurate gaussian expansions have been compared for the required extended precision arithmetic. The first is based on Gaussian quadratures and the second on direct optimization. Both use the Maple computer algebra system. Numerical results are tabulated and compared with previous work. Special cases are found to agree before pushing the optimization technique further.

	abstract = {Gaunt coefficients express angular momentum conservation rules. They are therefore required in the combination of atomic orbitals. In this case, the angular factors are spherical harmonics and the Gaunt coefficients appear when their products are linearized. The Gaunt coefficients may be pre-calculated and stored. This work describes new index functions for storing and retrieving the required Gaunt coefficients that are (almost) all nonzero. This strategy is closely related to that of Rasch and Yu, who have compared retrieval to that using recurrence relations and found it to be at least 20 times faster. Some improvements to their work will be found here and the index functions used are different. Only a few arithmetic operations are required to generate the index; therefore, its evaluation and handling takes a negligible time compared to its applications, notably molecular electronic integral evaluation. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {Two families of derivative free two-point iterative methods for solving nonlinear equations are constructed. These methods use a suitable parametric function and an arbitrary real parameter. It is proved that the first family has the convergence order four requiring only three function evaluations per iteration. In this way it is demonstrated that the proposed family without memory supports the Kung–Traub hypothesis (1974) on the upper bound 2n of the order of multipoint methods based on n\&\#xa0;+\&\#xa0;1 function evaluations. Further acceleration of the convergence rate is attained by varying a free parameter from step to step using information available from the previous step. This approach leads to a family of two-step self-accelerating methods with memory whose order of convergence is at least 2 + 5 ≈ 4.236 and even 2 + 6 ≈ 4.449 in special cases. The increase of convergence order is attained without any additional calculations so that the family of methods with memory possesses a very high computational efficiency. Numerical examples are included to demonstrate exceptional convergence speed of the proposed methods using only few function evaluations.},

It is proved that these methods have the convergence order 2 n , requiring only n + 1 function evaluations per iteration. In this way it is demonstrated that the proposed class of methods supports the Kung—Traub hypothesis (1974) on the upper bound 2 n of the order of multipoint methods based on n + 1 function evaluations. Consequently, this class possess as high as possible computational efficiency in the sense of the Kung—Traub hypothesis. Numerical examples are included to demonstrate exceptional convergence speed with only few function evaluations.},

The alternative expression obtained allows convergence accelerator techniques to be directly applied in a very effective manner. The resulting expansion is found to be numerically stable, in contrast to the series obtained when convergence accelerator techniques are applied to the standard expansion. Using this approach, the increase in computational speed is found to be very significant for the most slowly converging integrals. Some representative values are presented for a number of three-electron correlated integrals calculated using the method suggested herein.},

In the particular case where the terms of the sequence to be transformed are the partial sums of a formal power series, this transformation leads to Padé-type approximants. Then, using various operators, some extensions of Drummond's process are proposed, and their properties are given. A new expression for the E-transformation, using generalized divided differences, is obtained, and it is also generalized. The recurrence relation for these differences can be used for its implementation, and the Ford–Sidi algorithm is also related to them.

	doi = {10.1016/j.ccr.2016.06.016},
	abstract = {Abstract Cu(I) complexes often show transitions of distinct metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) character. This can lead to small energy separations between the lowest singlet \{S1\} and triplet \{T1\} state. Hence, thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and, if applied to electroluminescent devices, singlet harvesting can become highly effective. In this contribution, we introduce the \{TADF\} mechanism and identify crucial parameters that are necessary to optimize materials properties, in particular, with respect to short emission decay times and high quantum yields at ambient temperature. In different case studies, we present a photophysical background for a deeper understanding of the materials properties. Accordingly, we elucidate strategies for obtaining high quantum yields. These are mainly based on enhancing the intrinsic rigidity of the complexes and of their environment. Efficient \{TADF\} essentially requires small energy separations ?E(S1?T1) with preference below about 1000 cm-1 (?120 meV). This is achievable with complexes that exhibit small spatial HOMO?LUMO overlap. Thus, energy separations below 300 cm-1 (?37 meV) are obtained, giving short radiative \{TADF\} decay times of less than 5 ?s. In a case study, it is shown that the \{TADF\} properties may be tuned or the \{TADF\} effect can even be turned off. However, very small ?E(S1?T1) energy separations are related to small radiative rates or small oscillator strengths of the \{S1\} ? \{S0\} transitions due to the (required) small HOMO?LUMO overlap, as discussed in a further case study. Moreover, large spin?orbit coupling (SOC) of the triplet state to higher lying singlet states can induce an additional phosphorescence decay path that leads to a luminescence consisting of \{TADF\} and phosphorescence, thus leading to a combined singlet harvesting and triplet harvesting mechanism. This gives an overall reduction of the decay time. Finally, in a strongly simplified model, the \{SOC\} efficiency is traced back to easily obtainable results from \{DFT\} calculations.},

	abstract = {The integral bottleneck in evaluating molecular energies arises from the two-electron contributions. These are difficult and time-consuming to evaluate, especially over exponential type orbitals, used here to ensure the correct behavior of atomic orbitals. The two-center two-electron integrals are essential to describe atom pairs in molecules and distinguish those that are bound. In this work on analytical integration, it is shown that the two-center Coulomb integrals involved can be expressed as one-electron kinetic energy-like integrals. This is accomplished using the fact that the Coulomb operator is a Green's function of the Laplacian. The ensuing integrals may be further simplified by defining spectral forms for the one-electron potential satisfying Poisson's equation therein. A sum of overlap integrals with the atomic orbital energy eigenvalue as a factor is then obtained to give the Coulomb energy. This is most easily evaluated by direct integration. The orbitals involved in three and four center integrals are translated to two centers. This is discussed very briefly. The evaluation of exchange energy is a straightforward extension of this work. The summation coefficients in spectral forms are evaluated analytically from Gaunt coefficients. The Poisson method may be used to calculate Coulomb energy integrals efficiently. For a single processor, gains of CPU time for a given chemical accuracy exceed a factor of 4. This method lends itself to efficient evaluation on a parallel computer. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {Confining carbon dots (CDs) in zeolites may boost the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emission. However, so far only blue-emissive CD-based TADF materials are reported, and rationally tuning the TADF emission of these materials remains challenging. Herein, by in situ embedding different emissive CDs into a zeolite matrix, we have successfully prepared a series of CD@zeolite composites with tunable TADF emission from blue to green by utilizing energy transfer (ET) between confined CDs. The as-prepared CD@zeolite composites exhibit lifetimes varying from 271 ms to 860 ms and quantum yields ranging from 20\% to 42\%. The ET process occurs from the singlet excited state of the blue emissive CD donor to the singlet excited state of green emissive CD acceptors with different polymerization degrees, promoting tunable TADF with cyan, mint green and olive green emission. The design concept proposed in this work may open a way to judicious tuning of the emission of TADF materials, and thus may broaden the applications of CD-based TADF materials.},

Their fluorescence emission is strongly enhanced and their colors are changed upon assembly, which can be ascribed to the supramolecular assembly-induced enhanced emission and Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) processes between H1-4C4P (or H2-2C4P) and DSA-G. Both ensembles of DSA-G⊂H1-4C4P and DSA-G⊂H2-2C4P exhibit thermo and solvent dual-responsive features, while DSA-G⊂H2-2C4P shows higher sensitivity toward external stimuli as compared to DSA G⊂H1-4C4P due to the shorter distance between fluorophores.

	volume = {6655},
	url = {https://doi.org/10.1117/12.731225},
	abstract = {In this study, detailed spectroscopic investigations of the blue emitting compounds Ir(4,6-dFppy)$_{\textrm{2}}$(pic) and Pt(4,6-
dFppy)(acac) are presented. Due to spin-orbit coupling (SOC) of the emitting triplet state with higher lying singlet states
both complexes show an intense phosphorescence and are utilized as emitters in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs).
Distinct differences with respect to important photophysical properties are found for the two compounds.
For example, the (distorted) octahedral Ir(4,6-dFppy)$_{\textrm{2}}$(pic) complex exhibits a shorter emission decay time and shows a
larger zero-field splitting (ZFS) than the (distorted) square planar Pt(4,6-dFppy)(acac) complex (\&tau;(Ir) = 0.4 \&mu;s and \&tau;(Pt)
= 3.6 \&mu;s of the respective shortest-lifed triplet substate; \&Delta;(ZFS, Ir) = 67 cm$^{\textrm{-1}}$, \&Delta;E(ZFS, Pt) = 8 cm$^{\textrm{-1}}$). This behaviour is
connected with the extent of metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT, d\&pi;*) character in the emitting triplet state. High
MLCT character usually results in a high emission decay rate and indicates a good suitability as OLED emitter material.
Of crucial importance in this respect is the effectiveness of SOC. In this study it is shown that the SOC routes depend on
the coordination geometry of the emitter compound. In particular, the couplings can be more effective in (distorted)
octahedral than in (distorted) square planar compounds. Hence, the photophysical differences of Ir(4,6-dFppy)$_{\textrm{2}}$(pic)
compared to Pt(4,6-dFppy)(acac) can be rationalized. Moreover, this investigation shows that the analysis of SOC paths
provides general guidelines for the design of efficient emitters for OLED applications.},

The algorithm for the computation of the Hermite-Padé polynomials is based on a set of recursive equations which were derived from a generalization of continued fractions. The approximations retain their validity even on the cuts of the complex Riemann surface which allows for example the calculation of resonances in quantum mechanical problems.

These functions can be numerically approximated by summation methods even if the corresponding series is only asymptotic. With the help of Hermite-Padé-approximants many different approximation schemes can be realized. Padé and algebraic approximants are just well-known examples. Hermite-Padé-approximants combine the advantages of highly accurate numerical results with the additional advantage of being able to sum complex multi-valued functions. Method of solution: Special type Hermite-Padé polynomials are calculated for a set of divergent series. These polynomials are then used to implicitly define approximants for one of the functions of this set. This approximant can be numerically evaluated at any point of the Riemann surface of this function. For an approximation order not greater than 3 the approximants can alternatively be expressed in closed form and then be used to approximate the desired function on its complete Riemann surface. Restriction on the complexity of the problem: In principle, the algorithm is only limited by the available memory and speed of the underlying computer system. Furthermore the achievable accuracy of the approximation only depends on the number of known series coefficients of the function to be approximated assuming of course that these coefficients are known with enough accuracy.

Photophysical investigations show efficient TADF at ambient temperature due to the sterical hindrance between the donor and acceptor moieties. The photoluminescence quantum yield amounts to ΦPL = 80\% in toluene and 90\% in PMMA arising from prompt and delayed fluorescence with decay times of 21 ns and 30 μs, respectively. From an Arrhenius plot, the energy gap ΔE(S1 – T1) between the lowest excited singlet S1 and triplet T1 state was determined to be 980 cm–1 (120 meV).

The components of the vector q = q(q1, q2,...qd) are parameters which define the molecular geometry, and d is the total number of internal degrees of freedom defining the nuclear configuration space. This pointwise representation of the surface is rarely of much use either in visualization of the surface or in calculations of the reaction dynamics. A continuous representation can be derived from the given points by fitting a function to them. While the form of the function is at the disposal of the researcher, the effort required to obtain a given accuracy of fit can depend strongly on the functional form chosen. Several classes of functions have been used in interpolations, e.g., cubic splines,1 polynomials,2 Padé approximants,3 and ad hoc functions suggested by the physics of the problem.4,5 None of these, except perhaps the last, are particularly suited to the representation of potential surfaces in that these surfaces are not of the same form as the fitting function. For example, polynomials are not bounded as their arguments go to plus or minus infinity, have a fixed number of extrema and inflection points, and cannot be multi-valued as can potential surfaces if more than one state of the molecule in question is considered.},

	abstract = {Cu(I) complexes often show transitions of distinct metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) character. This can lead to small energy separations between the lowest singlet S1 and triplet T1 state. Hence, thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and, if applied to electroluminescent devices, singlet harvesting can become highly effective. In this contribution, we introduce the TADF mechanism and identify crucial parameters that are necessary to optimize materials’ properties, in particular, with respect to short emission decay times and high quantum yields at ambient temperature. In different case studies, we present a photophysical background for a deeper understanding of the materials’ properties. Accordingly, we elucidate strategies for obtaining high quantum yields. These are mainly based on enhancing the intrinsic rigidity of the complexes and of their environment. Efficient TADF essentially requires small energy separations ΔE(S1–T1) with preference below about 1000cm−1 (≈120meV). This is achievable with complexes that exhibit small spatial HOMO–LUMO overlap. Thus, energy separations below 300cm−1 (≈37meV) are obtained, giving short radiative TADF decay times of less than 5μs. In a case study, it is shown that the TADF properties may be tuned or the TADF effect can even be turned off. However, very small ΔE(S1–T1) energy separations are related to small radiative rates or small oscillator strengths of the S1→S0 transitions due to the (required) small HOMO–LUMO overlap, as discussed in a further case study. Moreover, large spin–orbit coupling (SOC) of the triplet state to higher lying singlet states can induce an additional phosphorescence decay path that leads to a luminescence consisting of TADF and phosphorescence, thus leading to a combined singlet harvesting and triplet harvesting mechanism. This gives an overall reduction of the decay time. Finally, in a strongly simplified model, the SOC efficiency is traced back to easily obtainable results from DFT calculations.},

	abstract = {The interest in organic molecules exhibiting thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) has been reinvigorated in recent years owing to their potential to be exploited as emitters in highly efficient purely organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, designing new molecules that exhibit efficient TADF is a non-trivial task because they would appear to require the optimisation of a number of contrasting properties. For example these molecules must exhibit rapid conversion between the singlet and triplet manifolds without the use of heavy elements to enhance spin–orbit coupling. They should also display a large fluorescence rate, but simultaneously a small energy gap between low lying singlet and triplet states. Consequently to achieve systematic material design, a detailed understanding of the fundamental factors influencing the photophysical behaviour of TADF emitters is essential. Towards achieving this goal, theory and computation is playing a crucial role. In this feature article the recent progress in the theory of organic TADF molecules in the context of OLEDs is presented, with a view of achieving a deeper understanding of these molecules and driving systematic material design.},

The analytic representations of three-center nuclear attraction integrals and multicenter bielectronic integrals over B functions involve semiinfinite highly oscillatory integrals, which can be transformed into infinite series. These integrals must be evaluated precisely and quickly. This work describes an efficient method for the evaluation of these integrals based on the nonlinear SD transformation, recently developed by Safouhi. The SD method was applied to multicenter integrals over B functions, and it is shown that this method is highly efficient compared with alternatives previously used. The SD approach should lead to a definitive suite of ab initio Slater software. The convergence properties were analyzed and they showed that the approximations obtained using the SD approach converge to the exact values of the semiinfinite integrals without any constraint. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

A variety of concrete numerical examples and relevant results are extensively treated to verify the underlying theoretical development.

Whereas the polynomials are independent of the type (GTO, BTO, or STO) of basis functions, the coefficients depend on both the class of integral (overlap, kinetic energy, nuclear attraction) and the type of basis functions. We present the general expression of polynomials and coefficients as well as the recurrence relations for both the polynomials and the whole integrals.

Closed-form expressions are obtained for the general three- and four-center Gaussian integral. The solid harmonic addition formula can be used to express these integrals as sums of products of an exponent-independent (angular) factor and a molecular-orientation-independent (exponential) factor in a variety of ways. The results are products of two such factors summed over the set of distinct, relevant polynomials of the exponents. The coefficients of these polynomials, angular factors, are complicated but common to all n-center matrix elements and independent of any type of contraction. Derivatives must be obtained using the product rule. An implementation in the Solid Spherical Harmonic Gaussian (SSHG) computer code is outlined and preliminary comparison is made. © 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc. Int J Quant Chem 81: 373–383, 2001},

An accurate and efficient spectral tau technique for solving the fractional diffusion equations numerically is proposed. This method is based upon Chebyshev tau approximation together with Chebyshev operational matrix of Caputo fractional differentiation. Such approach has the advantage of reducing the problem to the solution of a system of algebraic equations, which may then be solved by any standard numerical technique. We apply this general method to solve four specific examples. In each of the examples considered, the numerical results show that the proposed method is of high accuracy and is efficient for solving the time-dependent fractional diffusion equations.},

	abstract = {A divergent perturbation series is known to yield very unreliable results for observables even at moderate coupling strengths. One of the most popular techniques in handling such series is to express them as rational functions, but it is often faithful only for small coupling. We outline here how one can gain considerable advantages in the large-coupling regime by properly embedding known asymptotic scaling relations for selected observables during construction of the aforesaid Padé approximants. Three new bypass routes are explored in this context. The first approach involves a weighted geometric mean of two neighboring PA. The second idea is to consider series for specific ratios of observables. The third strategy is to express observables as functionals of the total energy in the form of series expansions. Symanzik's scaling relation, and the virial and Hellmann–Feynman theorems, are used at appropriate places to aid each of the strategies. Pilot calculations on the ground-state perturbation series of certain observables for the quartic anharmonic oscillator problem reveal readily the benefit and novelty. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Two methods for implementing the LSC-IVR/classical Wigner which are in principle feasible to be combined with general force fields or even ab initio electronic structure methods have been reviewed. One is the local Gaussian approximation with the imaginary time path integral approach, the other is the quantum thermal bath method.

Numerical experiments comparing the proposed method with other existing methods which are MATLAB’s functions expm and funm show that our approach is also very effective and reliable for computing the matrix exponential . Moreover, there are two main advantages of our approach. One is that there is no inverse of a matrix required in this method. The other is that this method is more convenient when computing for a fixed matrix A with many t .ge. 0.},

Der skalare Anteil der B-Funktionen ist im wesentlichen durch eine reduzierte Bessel-Funktion gegeben. Bei diesen Untersuchungen werden Integraltransformationsmethoden zugrundegelegt. Dazu gehören die bereits genannte Fourier-Transformationsmethode und die Bessel-Transformationsmethode, die auf einer neuentdeckten, eindimensionalen Integraldarstellung für das Produkt zweier beliebiger reduzierter Bessel-Funktionen beruht, aus der eindimensionale Integraldarstellungen für zweizentrige Dichten zweier B-Funktionen hergeleitet werden. Diese zweizentrigen Dichten und ihre Fourier-Transformierten kann man aber als wesentlichen Baustein von mehrzentrigen Molekülintegralen mit B-Funktionen auffassen. Die Verwendung dieser Transformationsmethoden erlaubt folgerichtig die Herleitung einer Reihe von neuen Darstellungen für Molekülintegrale mit B-Funktionen. Numerisch werden vor allem Integraldarstellungen für Molekülintegrale mit B-Funktionen untersucht, die man mit der Fourier-Transformationsmethode herleiten kann. Für die numerische Auswertung dieser Integraldarstellungen werden neue Quadraturverfahren eingeführt. Besondere Berücksichtigung dabei findet der Fall stark unterschiedlicher Exponentialparameter, für den herkömmliche Methoden Schwierigkeiten haben. Durch eingehende Analyse wird als Grund dieser Schwierigkeiten das Auftreten von bestimmten Gewichtsfunktionen festgestellt. Diese Gewichtsfunktionen verursachen scharfe Spitzen, die die numerische Quadratur stark erschweren. Dieses Problem wird gelöst mit Hilfe von speziellen Koordinatentransformationen, den Möbius-Transformationen, und den darauf aufbauenden, neuen Quadraturverfahren. - Abschnitt 1: Einleitung (Quantenchemische Näherungsverfahren, Übersicht über die Arbeit und Abgrenzung des Themas) Abschnitt 2: Zusammenstellung wichtiger Definitionen und Bezeichnungen Abschnitt 3: Allgemeine Eigenschaften von B-Funktionen und Produkten von B-Funktionen Abschnitt 4: Integraltransformationsmethoden zur Behandlung von Molekülintegralen mit B-Funktionen Abschnitt 5: Numerische Quadraturverfahren bei Molekülintegralen mit B-Funktionen Abschnitt 6: Ein-Elektron-Integrale bei B-Funktionen: Fourier-Transformierte von Produkten zweier B-Funktionen, Überlappungsintegrale und verwandte Integrale Abschnitt 7: Ein-Elektron-Integrale mit B-Funktionen: Kernanziehungsintegrale Abschnitt 8: Zwei-Elektronen-Integrale mit B-Funktionen Anhang A: Einige Details über reduzierte Bessel-Funktionen Anhang B: Einige Größen mit Bezug zur Kugeldrehgruppe Anhang C: Programmtechnische Details Anhang D: Zweizentrige Produkte zweier B-Funktionen: Rekursionen Anhang E: Umrechnung von Laguerre-Regeln Anhang F: Zur Implementierung der Regel W\$”\$ Anhang G: Eigenschaften der Sigma-Funktionen},

In this work, the relative merits of various exponential-type orbitals (ETOs) are investigated for solving problems of interest to nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), while showing how they are related mathematically. The preferred ETOs will be shown to be the hydrogenic orbitals and similar Coulomb Sturmians. Slater-type functions (STFs) will be compared with them, and suitable equivalent (seldom used) combinations given. The correct shielding of the nucleus, resulting from radial factors of hydrogenic orbitals, is finally shown to be essential in the evaluation of precise nuclear shielding tensors for NMR spectroscopy of molecules using ab initio or DFT methods. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {Gaunt coefficients express angular momentum conservation rules. They are therefore required in the combination of atomic orbitals. In this case, the angular factors are spherical harmonics and the Gaunt coefficients appear when their products are linearized. The Gaunt coefficients may be pre-calculated and stored. This work describes new index functions for storing and retrieving the required Gaunt coefficients that are (almost) all nonzero. This strategy is closely related to that of Rasch and Yu, who have compared retrieval to that using recurrence relations and found it to be at least 20 times faster. Some improvements to their work will be found here and the index functions used are different. Only a few arithmetic operations are required to generate the index; therefore, its evaluation and handling takes a negligible time compared to its applications, notably molecular electronic integral evaluation. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

These methods use a suitable parametric function and an arbitrary real parameter. It is proved that the first family has the convergence order four requiring only three function evaluations per iteration. In this way it is demonstrated that the proposed family without memory supports the Kung–Traub hypothesis (1974) on the upper bound 2n of the order of multipoint methods based on n\&\#xa0;+\&\#xa0;1 function evaluations. Further acceleration of the convergence rate is attained by varying a free parameter from step to step using information available from the previous step. This approach leads to a family of two-step self-accelerating methods with memory whose order of convergence is at least 2 + 5 ≈ 4.236 and even 2 + 6 ≈ 4.449 in special cases. The increase of convergence order is attained without any additional calculations so that the family of methods with memory possesses a very high computational efficiency. Numerical examples are included to demonstrate exceptional convergence speed of the proposed methods using only few function evaluations.},

It is proved that these methods have the convergence order 2 n , requiring only n + 1 function evaluations per iteration. In this way it is demonstrated that the proposed class of methods supports the Kung—Traub hypothesis (1974) on the upper bound 2 n of the order of multipoint methods based on n + 1 function evaluations. Consequently, this class possess as high as possible computational efficiency in the sense of the Kung—Traub hypothesis. Numerical examples are included to demonstrate exceptional convergence speed with only few function evaluations.},

Using this approach, the increase in computational speed is found to be very significant for the most slowly converging integrals.

Our approach leads to considerable simplification of the derivation of analytical representations for the overlap integrals over Slater type orbitals. In this approach, the representations of overlap integrals with both the same and different screening parameters have been obtained with the help of the Rayleigh expansion of a plane wave in terms of spherical Bessel functions and spherical harmonics. Analytical expressions obtained by this method have been expressed in terms of Gaunt coefficients, which are the product of spherical harmonics, Gegenbauer, and binomial coefficients.

In order to test the accuracy of the formula for two-center overlap integrals, we performed an extensive study in which quantum numbers, orbital exponents, and internuclear distances were varied over wide ranges.

The convergence of the method is tested for two-center overlap, nuclear attraction, and two-electron one-center integrals, due to the scarcity of the literature, and fair uniform convergence and great numerical stability under wide changes in molecular parameters is achieved. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {Laplace transform is a powerful method for enabling solving differential equation in engineering and science. Using the Laplace transform for solving differential equations, however, sometimes leads to solutions in the Laplace domain that are not readily invertible to the real domain by analytical means. Numerical inversion methods are then used to convert the obtained solution from the Laplace domain into the real domain. Four inversion methods are evaluated in this paper. Several test functions, which arise in engineering applications, are used to evaluate the inversion methods. We also show that each of the inversion methods is accurate for a particular case. This study shows that among all these methods, the Fourier transform inversion technique is the most powerful but also the most computationally expensive. Stehfest’s method, which is used in many engineering applications is easy to implement and leads to accurate results for many problems including diffusion-dominated ones and solutions that behave like e−t type functions. However, this method fails to predict et type functions or those with an oscillatory response, such as sine and wave functions.},

Here, we propose to illustrate the feasibility of attacking the problem of the multiple integrations needed entirely by numerical quadratures, in conjunction with a strategic program organization that allows evaluating simultaneously sets of thousands of integrals exploiting the mean characteristics of the integrands. This approach, envisaged and implemented many years ago by two of the present authors (C.G., O.S.), perhaps without adequate exposure, is endowed in our experience with good properties. The program package, which allows dealing on the same footing with linear and nonlinear molecular geometries, has been largely revised by introducing suitable adjustments and improvements (in particular extension to orbitals with azimuthal quantum number l=3). © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The matrix quotients are based on the generalized inverse for a matrix introduced by Gu Chuanqing and Chen Zhibing (1995) which is found to be effective in continued fraction interpolation. A sufficient condition of existence is obtained. Some important conclusions such as characterisation and uniqueness are proven respectfully.

The modification is performed by taking an interpolating polynomial to replace either f ( z n ) or f ′ ( z n ) . In six of the eight methods we have used a Hermite interpolating polynomial. The other two schemes use inverse interpolation. We discovered that the eighth order methods based on Jarratt’s optimal fourth order methods perform well and those based on King’s or Kung–Traub’s methods do not. In all cases tested, the replacement of f ( z ) by Hermite interpolation is better than the replacement of the derivative, f ′ ( z ) .},

Here we compare five such methods, two of which require the evaluation of the $^{\textrm{st\$}}$ root. The methods are usually compared by evaluating the computational efficiency and the efficiency index. In this paper all the methods have the same efficiency, since they are of the same order and use the same information. Frequently, comparisons of the various schemes are based on the number of iterations required for convergence, number of function evaluations, and/or amount of \{CPU\} time. If a particular algorithm does not converge or if it converges to a different solution, then that particular algorithm is thought to be inferior to the others. The primary flaw in this type of comparison is that the starting point represents only one of an infinite number of other choices. Here we use the basin of attraction idea to recommend the best fourth order method. The basin of attraction is a method to visually comprehend how an algorithm behaves as a function of the various starting points.},

The present investigation offers an advantage in that general formulas are derived which facilitate computation of the overlap and related two-center integrals over all Slater-type orbitals (STOs) with eventual nonintegral values of the principal quantum number. The proposed algorithm permits to avoid the procedure of interpolation [A. Baba-Ahmed and J. Gayoso, Theor. Chim.

The coefficients of its denominator polynomials are determined by taking the direct inner product of matrices. The remainder formula is developed and an algorithm for the numerator polynomials is presented when the generating polynomials are given in advance. By means of the Hankel-like coefficient matrix, a determinantal expression of B M P T A is presented. Moreover, to avoid the computation of the determinants, two efficient recursive algorithms are proposed. At the end the method of B M P T A is applied to partial realization problems of 2-D linear systems.},

	abstract = {Abstract Based on the fourth-order method of Liu et al. [10], eighth-order three-step iterative methods without memory, which are totally free from derivative calculation and reach the optimal efficiency index are presented. The extension of one of the methods for multiple zeros without the knowledge of multiplicity is presented. Further accelerations will be provided through the concept of with memory iteration methods. Moreover, it is shown by way of illustration that the novel methods are useful on a series of relevant numerical problems when high precision computing is required.},

	abstract = {Recently, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have become a dazzling star among porous materials used in many fields. Considering their intriguing features, MOFs have great prospects for application in the field of sustainable agriculture, especially as versatile pesticide-delivery vehicles. However, the study of MOF-based platforms for controlled pesticide release has just begun. Controlled pesticide release responsive to environmental stimuli is highly desirable for decreased agrochemical input, improved control efficacy and diminished adverse effects. In this work, simple, octahedral, iron-based MOFs (NH2-Fe-MIL-101) were synthesized through a microwave-assisted solvothermal method using Fe3+ as the node and 2-aminoterephthalic acid as the organic ligand. Diniconazole (Dini), as a model fungicide, was loaded into NH2-Fe-MIL-101 to afford Dini@NH2-Fe-MIL-101 with a satisfactory loading content of 28.1\%. The subsequent polydopamine (PDA) modification could endow Dini with pH-sensitive release patterns. The release of Dini from PDA@Dini@NH2-Fe-MIL-101 was much faster in an acidic medium compared to that in neutral and basic media. Moreover, Dini@NH2-Fe-MIL-101 and PDA@Dini@NH2-Fe-MIL-101 displayed good bioactivities against the pathogenic fungus causing wheat head scab (Fusarium graminearum). This research sought to reveal the feasibility of versatile MOFs as a pesticide-delivery platform in sustainable crop protection.},

Results of the calculations are very visual, allowing one to picture the motion of particles.

Experimental obstacles include not only those associated with carrying out the experiment, e.g., preparing, characterizing, and maintaining a clean flat single-crystal surface, but also the difficulty of deriving useful information from the results. Information relating to features of the interaction potential may be masked by other processes. For example, prior thermalization of reactants on the surface or post thermalization of products can preclude extraction of the kind of state-to-state information2 that has been so valuable in characterizing gas-phase Interactions. Nevertheless, there is some hopeful recent progress toward improving our knowledge of gas-surface interactions, both on the experimental and theoretical fronts.},

	abstract = {Reactions of atomic oxygen and carbon in the excited 1D state with simple (i.e., single-bonded) diatomic molecules are considerably more varied than those involving hydrogen (2S) and halogen (2P) atoms. The chemistry of these systems is too complex to be understood in terms of the usual A + BC LEPS-type model potentials. A quasiclassical trajectory investigation of the dynamics of these reactions therefore requires the use of a more sophisticated representation of the interaction potential. One interesting aspect of the various reactions involving 1D atoms is the method of attack of the oxygen or carbon atom on the diatomic molecule. The atom can approach the diatomic so as to “insert” into the original bond and form a collision complex which subsequently decomposes. The driving force for such reactions arises from the deep potential well associated with the lowest singlet state of the three atom system, e.g., H2O(X 1A′) and {\textbackslash}(CH\_\{2\}({\textbackslash}tilde\{a\}{\textasciicircum}\{1\}A\{\}'){\textbackslash}). In another mode of attack, the incident atom may “abstract” an atom from the diatomic molecule in a direct reaction without entering the potential well. Trajectory studies can provide detailed information about the reaction pathways. When a collision complex does form, the behavior of the complex can be monitored to give information on the lifetimes of the complexes and the degree of randomization of the internal energy before the complex decomposes.},

The calculation of accurate, detailed dynamical quantities such as inelastic and reactive cross sections requires a knowledge of the potential energy surface over large regions of the configuration space. Thermal rate constants represent an average of such detailed dynamical quantities, and as a result they are less sensitive to fine features of the surface. Thus accurate thermal rate constants may be calculated using less information about the potential surfaces than is required to calculate more detailed quantities; one of the goals of the present chapter is to discuss which regions of the surfaces are most important in controlling the rates of chemical reactions.},

The structure in the collinear H + H2 results on a smoothly varying surface, at energies above the vibrational excitation threshold of reaction products, was guessed1b as being due to interference effects between different reaction paths, a guess subsequently confirmed by a quantum mechanical lifetime analysis8 and a semiclassical calculation.9 The former indicated the concomitant presence of and interference between direct and dynamic resonance (Feshbach10) processes. The mechanism of such resonances was attributed to the existence of wells in the vibrationally adiabatic potentials along the minimum energy path.2b},

	abstract = {The reaction O(3P) + H2 → OH + H is of fundamental importance in the combustion of molecular hydrogen and hydrogen-containing fuels. Many experimental studies of the rate constant for this reaction have been made over a large temperature range. A review of the experimental work is given in reference 1. Recently, this reaction has received considerable theoretical attention. Two semi-empirical LEPS type potential energy surfaces have been constructed for this reaction.2,3 These have been used to determine transition state theory rate constants2 as well as rate constants from quasi-classical trajectory calculations.3 In the latter study, the quasi-classical rate constant for reaction of H2(v=1) was also calculated.3 Diatomics-in-molecules (DIM) potential surfaces for the O(3P) and O(1D) + H2 systems have also been reported4 and used in quasiclassical trajectory calculations.4 More recently, two Ab initio determinations of the O(3P) + H2 potential energy surfaces have been reported.5,6 A review of all of the O(3P) + H2 potential surfaces is given in reference 6. Quasiclassical trajectory calculations of the reaction cross sections and rate constants for H2 in the ground and first two excited vibrational states have been reported,7 using the potential reported in reference 5.},

	abstract = {During the past decade, many new results have been obtained on the dynamics of elementary chemical reactions. One of the most intensively studied reactions continues to be the process F + H2(v,j) → FH(v′,j′) + H. Many experimental and theoretical results on this reaction have been discussed in recent reviews.1,2 On the experimental side, the F + H2 reaction with isotopic variants has been studied under chemical laser conditions,3-5 through IR chemiluminescence,6,7 and in crossed molecular beam machines.8,9 Recent crossed beam studies by Sparks et al. 9 are particularly relevant to the present study and will be discussed in more detail later in this section. On the theoretical side, very extensive quasiclassical trajectory studies on a number of potential surfaces have provided many new dynamical results for the three-dimensional reactions.1,2,10 The first quantum collinear studies11-13 of this reaction showed a dramatic difference from the low-energy quasiclassical results12 for the collinear reaction. At these low energies, there is a sharp resonance in the quantum mechanical v=0→v′=2 reaction probability curve, followed by a slow growth In the 0 → 3 reaction probability. The 0 → 2 resonance is the most striking feature of the low-energy collinear reaction. Since these first quantum collinear studies, many other quantum studies of the collinear reaction have appeared.14-16 Connor has recently presented a comprehensive review of these results.16 In attempting to understand the origin of the 0 → 2 collinear resonnance, Latham et al. 15 displayed plots of the scattering wavefunction and flux in the interaction region. In addition, Hayes and Walker17 have recently found that removal of the 0.05 eV entrance-channel barrier destroys this sharp resonance feature.},

Beyond the critical cluster size subsequent cluster growth results in a decrease in the free energy and the process occurs spontaneously.

	abstract = {Ab initio molecular orbital (MO) methods can provide accurate descriptions of potential energy surfaces for chemical reactions. For triatomic systems such as H3 and H2F extensive calculations of very accurate potential surfaces have been carried out. For systems having four atoms or more, however, the accomplishment so far has been rather limited. One of the reasons for this is that the full potential energy surface is a function of 3N-6 coordinates where N is the number of atoms, and this is too many degrees of freedom for the full surface to be mapped. Even to optimize the geometrical parameters for all the degrees of freedom to determine the reactant and saddle point geometries is very difficult. However, a revolution is taking place in the way quantum chemists probe a potential surface. It is based on the development of new theoretical methods and computer programs for analytically calculating the gradient of the energy with respect to the nuclear coordinates.1 Quantum chemists are now learning how to use this energy gradient, a concept more familiar in the context of collision theory, to study the characteristics of potential energy surfaces. In this review we will first summarize briefly how to calculate the energy gradient analytically. Then we will discuss methods of determining geometries, force constants, and normal vibrations for both equilibrium configurations and saddle points, and we will show several examples of such calculations we have recently carried out.},

The components of the vector q = q(q1, q2,...qd) are parameters which define the molecular geometry, and d is the total number of internal degrees of freedom defining the nuclear configuration space. This pointwise representation of the surface is rarely of much use either in visualization of the surface or in calculations of the reaction dynamics. A continuous representation can be derived from the given points by fitting a function to them. While the form of the function is at the disposal of the researcher, the effort required to obtain a given accuracy of fit can depend strongly on the functional form chosen. Several classes of functions have been used in interpolations, e.g., cubic splines,1 polynomials,2 Padé approximants,3 and ad hoc functions suggested by the physics of the problem.4,5 None of these, except perhaps the last, are particularly suited to the representation of potential surfaces in that these surfaces are not of the same form as the fitting function. For example, polynomials are not bounded as their arguments go to plus or minus infinity, have a fixed number of extrema and inflection points, and cannot be multi-valued as can potential surfaces if more than one state of the molecule in question is considered.},

	abstract = {Reactive collisions typically involve dramatic changes in the electronic structure of the species, and it is necessary to account for these to calculate accurate potential energy surfaces, particularly in the critically important saddle-point or transition-structure regions. As a consequence a realistic theoretical description of reactive potential energy surfaces requires very accurate electronic wave functions;1-3 large flexible basis sets are necessary and the effects of electron correlation must be included. To date relatively few such studies have been carried out on systems involving more than three or four atoms.},

If mass-weighted cartesian coordinates are used, this is the reaction path,2 and the distance along it the (mass-weighted) reaction coordinate.},

The perspective is explicitly time dependent, although the theory given here is intended for interpretation of experiments in the frequency domain. We will travel back and forth between the time and frequency domains via Fourier transforms. Some of the characteristics of potential surfaces which we obtain are static ones, such as slopes and directions of excited (in absorption) or ground (in emission) potential surfaces in the Franck-Condon region. Other characterisitics are dynamic ones, involving certain decay and recurrence events which severely limit the form the potential surfaces may take but do not specify it completely.},

	abstract = {Quantum mechanical calculations produce potential energy surfaces in the form of values of the energy E(q) at many geometries. The components of the vector q = q(q1, q2,...qd) are parameters which define the molecular geometry, and d is the total number of internal degrees of freedom defining the nuclear configuration space. This pointwise representation of the surface is rarely of much use either in visualization of the surface or in calculations of the reaction dynamics. A continuous representation can be derived from the given points by fitting a function to them. While the form of the function is at the disposal of the researcher, the effort required to obtain a given accuracy of fit can depend strongly on the functional form chosen. Several classes of functions have been used in interpolations, e.g., cubic splines,1 polynomials,2 Padé approximants,3 and ad hoc functions suggested by the physics of the problem.4,5 None of these, except perhaps the last, are particularly suited to the representation of potential surfaces in that these surfaces are not of the same form as the fitting function. For example, polynomials are not bounded as their arguments go to plus or minus infinity, have a fixed number of extrema and inflection points, and cannot be multi-valued as can potential surfaces if more than one state of the molecule in question is considered.},

The order-by-order summation is less effective than the Feenberg series. The latter is obtained by renormalizing the unperturbed Hamilton operator by a constant factor that is optimized for the third order energy. In the fifth order case, the Feenberg series can be improved by order-dependent optimization of the parameter. Alternatively, one may use Pad\{{\textbackslash}'e\} approximants or a further method based on effective characteristic polynomials to accelerate the convergence of the perturbation series. Numerical evidence is presented that, besides the Feenberg-type approaches, suitable Pad\{{\textbackslash}'e\} approximants, and also the effective second order characteristic polynomial, are excellent tools for correlation energy estimation.},

	abstract = {"Let F(z) be a vector-valued function, F: C - CN, which is analytic at z=0 and meromorphic in a neighbourhood of z=0, and let its Maclaurin series be given. In this work we develop vector-valued rational approximation procedures for F(z) by applying vector extrapolation methods to the sequence of partial sums of its Maclaurin series. We analyze some of the algebraic and analytic properties of the rational approximations thus obtained and show that they are akin to Pad� approximants. In particular, we prove a Koenig-type theorem concerning their poles and a de Montessus-type theorem concerning their uniform convergence. We show how "optimal" approximations to multiple poles and to Laurent expansions about these poles can be constructed. Extensions of the procedures above and the accompanying theoretical results to functions defined in arbitrary linear spaces is also considered. One of the most interesting and immediate applications of the results of this work is to the matrix eigenvalue problem. In a new work we exploit the developments of the present work to devise bona fide generalizations of the classical power method that are especially suitable for very large and sparse matrices. These generalizations can be used to approximate simultaneously several of the largest distinct eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors and invariant subspaces of arbitrary matrices, which may or may not be diagonalizable, and are very closely related with known Krylov subspace methods.

	abstract = {Organic light emitting diodes based on fluorophores with a propensity for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) are able to circumvent limitations imposed on device efficiency by spin statistics. Molecules with a propensity for TADF necessarily have two properties: a small gap between the lowest lying singlet and triplet excited states and a large transition dipole moment for fluorescence. In this work, we demonstrate the use of a genetic algorithm to search a region of chemical space for molecules with these properties. This algorithm is based on a flexible and intuitive representation of the molecule as a tree data structure, in which the nodes correspond to molecular fragments. Our implementation takes advantage of hybrid parallel graphics processing unit accelerated computer clusters to allow efficient sampling while retaining a reasonably accurate description of the electronic structure (in this case, CAM-B3LYP/6-31G**). In total, we have identified 3792 promising candidate fluorophores from a chemical space containing 1.26 � 10**6 molecules. This required performing electronic structure calculations on only 7518 molecules, a small fraction of the full space. Several novel classes of molecules which show promise as fluorophores are presented.},

The norm of these matrices grows at the optimal rate O(N**2) for N-by-N matrices, in contrast to standard pseudospectral constructions that result in O(N**4) growth of the norm. The smaller norm has a big advantage when using the derivative matrix for solving time dependent problems such as wave propagation. The construction is based on representing the derivative operator as an integral kernel, and does not rely on the interpolating polynomials. In particular, we construct second derivative matrices that incorporate Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions on an interval and on the disk, but the method can be used to construct a wide variety of commonly used operators for solving \{PDEs\} and integral equations. The construction can be used with any quadrature, including traditional Gauss�Legendre quadratures, but we have found that by using quadratures based on prolate spheroidal wave functions, we can achieve a near optimal sampling rate close to two points per wavelength, even for non-periodic problems. We provide numerical results for the new construction and demonstrate that the construction achieves similar or better accuracy than traditional pseudospectral derivative matrices, while resulting in a norm that is orders of magnitude smaller than the standard construction. To demonstrate the advantage of the new construction, we apply the method for solving the wave equation in constant and discontinuous media and for solving \{PDEs\} on the unit disk. We also present two compression algorithms for applying the derivative matrices in O(N\&\#xa0;log\&\#xa0;N) operations.},

	abstract = {We propose the complex-plane generalization of a powerful algebraic sequence acceleration algorithm, the method of weighted averages (MWA), to guarantee exponential-cum-algebraic convergence of Fourier and Fourier�Hankel (F�H) integral transforms. This �complex-plane� MWA, effected via a linear-path detour in the complex plane, results in rapid, absolute convergence of field and potential solutions in multi-layered environments regardless of the source-observer geometry and anisotropy/loss of the media present. In this work, we first introduce a new integration path used to evaluate the field contribution arising from the radiation spectra. Subsequently, we (1) exhibit the foundational relations behind the complex-plane extension to a general Levin-type sequence convergence accelerator, (2) specialize this analysis to one member of the Levin transform family (the MWA), (3) address and circumvent restrictions, arising for two-dimensional integrals associated with wave dynamics problems, through minimal complex-plane detour restrictions and a novel partition of the integration domain, (4) develop and compare two formulations based on standard/real-axis \{MWA\} variants, and (5) present validation results and convergence characteristics for one of these two formulations.},

Efficient evaluation of three-center nuclear attraction integrals over STOs to predetermined accuracy is made possible by applying the nonlinear D and D transformations. These methods are implemented in Fortran subroutines. This work shows how the conditions of applicability for these transformations are readily proven to be satisfied using the Axiom symbolic computation system. Axiom also provides exact values of the integrals for comparison. Their evaluation by standard numerical quadrature methods (Gauss–Laguerre), proves inadequate: Certain parameters lead to inaccurate values for the integrals, whereas the transformed integrals are highly accurate and rapidly evaluated. © 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

The nonlinear D transformation, which is probably the most effective general approach for increasing the rate of convergence of semi-infinite oscillatory integrals, is presented. Molecular integrals over STFs are expressed as finite linear combinations of integrals over B functions. The basis set of B functions is suitable to apply the Fourier transform method, which led to analytic expressions, involving highly oscillatory functions, for molecular integrals. Efficient algorithms based on the D transformation are now developed for a numerical evaluation of molecular integrals over STFs. Numerical results that we obtained with linear and nonlinear molecules, and which are in agreement with those obtained using existing codes (Alchemy, STOP, and ADGGSTNGINT), show that the algorithms described in this work are relevant. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Since, however, one is normally interested in addition theorems of irreducible spherical tensors, the application of the translation operator in its Cartesian form exp (x′∂/∂x)exp (y′∂/∂y)exp (z′∂/∂z) would lead to enormous technical problems. A better alternative consists in using a series expansion for the translation operator exp (r′⋅∇) involving powers of the Laplacian ∇2 and spherical tensor gradient operators {\textbackslash}documentclassarticle{\textbackslash}pagestyleempty{\textbackslash}begindocument\${\textbackslash}mathcalY{\textasciicircum}m\_{\textbackslash}ell({\textbackslash}nabla)\${\textbackslash}enddocument, which are irreducible spherical tensors of ranks zero and ℓ, respectively (Santos, F.

The application of the translation operator in its spherical form is particularly simple in the case of B functions and leads to an addition theorem with a comparatively compact structure. Since other exponentially decaying functions like Slater-type functions, bound-state hydrogenic eigenfunctions, and other functions based on generalized Laguerre polynomials can be expressed by simple finite sums of B functions, the addition theorems for these functions can be written down immediately. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {A principal tool for the construction of the addition theorem of a function f is the translation operator er′⋅∇, which generates f(r+r′) by doing a three-dimensional Taylor expansion of f around r. In atomic and molecular quantum mechanics, one is usually interested in irreducible spherical tensors. In such a case, the application of the translation operator in its Cartesian form ex′∂/∂xey′∂/∂yez′∂/∂z leads to serious technical problems. A much more promising approach consists of the use of an operator expansion for er′⋅∇ which contains exclusively irreducible spherical tensors. This expansion contains as differential operators the Laplacian ∇2 and the spherical tensor gradient operator 𝒴 lm(∇), which is an irreducible spherical tensor of rank l. Thus, if 𝒴 lm(∇) is applied to another spherical tensor, the angular part of the resulting expression is completely determined by angular momentum coupling, whereas the radial part is obtained by differentiating the radial part of the spherical tensor with respect to r. Consequently, the systematic use of the spherical tensor gradient operator leads to a considerable technical simplification. In this way, the originally three-dimensional expansion problem in x, y, and z is reduced to an essentially one-dimensional expansion problem in r. The practical usefulness of this approach is demonstrated by constructing the Laplace expansion of the Coulomb potential as well as the addition theorems of the regular and irregular solid harmonics and of the Yukawa potential. © 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

Our approach is based on vector valued rational approximation where the approximants are determined by the denominator polynomials whose coefficients are obtained by solving an inexpensive linear least-squares problem. No matrix multiplications or divisions but matrix-vector products are required in the whole process. A technique of scaling and recurrence enables our method to be more effective when the problem is for fixed A , b and many values of t . We also give a backward error analysis in exact arithmetic for the truncation errors to derive our new algorithm. Preliminary numerical results illustrate that the new algorithm performs well.},

We used 9,10-bis-(2,2-diphenylvinyl)-anthracene single crystals to produce blue and green light from identical single-crystal transistors. We also observed red light, which corresponds to the emission from in-gap states that are caused by impurities. Importantly, each of these different colors corresponds to a distinguishable light polarization, which enables us to tune the emission color by using a light polarizer.},

The coefficients of its denominator polynomials are determined by taking the direct inner product of matrices. The remainder formula is developed and an algorithm for the numerator polynomials is presented when the generating polynomials are given in advance. By means of the Hankel-like coefficient matrix, a determinantal expression of B M P T A is presented. Moreover, to avoid the computation of the determinants, two efficient recursive algorithms are proposed. At the end the method of B M P T A is applied to partial realization problems of 2-D linear systems.},

Further acceleration of the convergence rate is attained by varying a free parameter from step to step using information available from the previous step. This approach leads to a family of two-step self-accelerating methods with memory whose order of convergence is at least 2 + 5 ≈ 4.236 and even 2 + 6 ≈ 4.449 in special cases. The increase of convergence order is attained without any additional calculations so that the family of methods with memory possesses a very high computational efficiency.

	abstract = {Gaunt coefficients express angular momentum conservation rules. They are therefore required in the combination of atomic orbitals. In this case, the angular factors are spherical harmonics and the Gaunt coefficients appear when their products are linearized. The Gaunt coefficients may be pre-calculated and stored. This work describes new index functions for storing and retrieving the required Gaunt coefficients that are (almost) all nonzero. This strategy is closely related to that of Rasch and Yu, who have compared retrieval to that using recurrence relations and found it to be at least 20 times faster. Some improvements to their work will be found here and the index functions used are different. Only a few arithmetic operations are required to generate the index; therefore, its evaluation and handling takes a negligible time compared to its applications, notably molecular electronic integral evaluation. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

These functions are generally chosen because of their compact Fourier transform, following Shavitt. The inverse Laplace transform in the square root of the variable is used for Gauss quadrature in this work. Two procedures for obtaining accurate gaussian expansions have been compared for the required extended precision arithmetic. The first is based on Gaussian quadratures and the second on direct optimization. Both use the Maple computer algebra system. Numerical results are tabulated and compared with previous work. Special cases are found to agree before pushing the optimization technique further. The optimal gaussian expansions of B functions obtained in this work are available for reference. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Int J Quantum Chem, 2009},

The nonlinear D transformation, which is probably the most effective general approach for increasing the rate of convergence of semi-infinite oscillatory integrals, is presented. Molecular integrals over STFs are expressed as finite linear combinations of integrals over B functions. The basis set of B functions is suitable to apply the Fourier transform method, which led to analytic expressions, involving highly oscillatory functions, for molecular integrals. Efficient algorithms based on the D transformation are now developed for a numerical evaluation of molecular integrals over STFs. Numerical results that we obtained with linear and nonlinear molecules, and which are in agreement with those obtained using existing codes (Alchemy, STOP, and ADGGSTNGINT), show that the algorithms described in this work are relevant. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This is especially the case for the polarizable formulation of these models, the recent advances in which we review here.

	abstract = {Quantum chemistry in the form of density functional theory (DFT) calculations is a powerful numerical experiment for predicting intermolecular interaction energies. However, no chemical insight is gained in this way beyond predictions of observables. Energy decomposition analysis (EDA) can quantitatively bridge this gap by providing values for the chemical drivers of the interactions, such as permanent electrostatics, Pauli repulsion, dispersion, and charge transfer. These energetic contributions are identified by performing DFT calculations with constraints that disable components of the interaction. This review describes the second-generation version of the absolutely localized molecular orbital EDA (ALMO-EDA-II). The effects of different physical contributions on changes in observables such as structure and vibrational frequencies upon complex formation are characterized via the adiabatic EDA. Example applications include red- versus blue-shifting hydrogen bonds; the bonding and frequency shifts of CO, N2, and BF bound to a [Ru(II)(NH3)5]2 + moiety; and the nature of the strongly bound complexes between pyridine and the benzene and naphthalene radical cations. Additionally, the use of ALMO-EDA-II to benchmark and guide the development of advanced force fields for molecular simulation is illustrated with the recent, very promising, MB-UCB potential.},

Initially, molecules and NPs are gathered into a single assembly inside the focus, and the laser is scattered and propagated through the assembly. The expanded laser further traps them at the edge of the assembly, producing a single assembly much larger than the focus along the surface. Amino acids and inorganic ionic compounds undergo crystallization and crystal growth, polystyrene NPs form periodic arrays and disklike structures with concentric circles or hexagonal packing, and Au NPs demonstrate assembling and swarming, in which the NPs fluctuate like a group of bees. These phenomena that depend on laser polarization are called optically evolved assembling at solution surfaces, and their dynamics and mechanisms are elucidated in this review. As a promising application in materials science, the optical trapping assembly of lead halide perovskites, supramolecules, and aggregation-induced emission enhancement–active molecules is demonstrated and future directions for fundamental study are discussed.},

Furthermore, adding a correlation functional to a multiconfigurational reference energy can lead to double counting of electron correlation. Multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory (MC-PDFT) overcomes both obstacles, the second by calculating the quantum mechanical part of the electronic energy entirely by a functional, and the first by using a functional of the total density and the on-top pair density rather than the spin densities. This allows one to calculate the energy of strongly correlated systems efficiently with a pair-density functional and a suitable multiconfigurational reference function. This article reviews MC-PDFT and related background information.},

Nevertheless, nearly 100 years later—despite astonishing advances in computational power—the state-of-the-art first-principles prediction of observables related to spectroscopy and scattering dynamics is surprisingly limited. For example, the water dimer, (H2O)2, with only six nuclei and 20 electrons, still presents a formidable challenge for full-dimensional variational calculations of bound states and is considered out of reach for rigorous scattering calculations. The extremely poor scaling of the most rigorous quantum methods is fundamental; however, recent progress in development of approximate methodologies has opened the door to fairly routine high-quality predictions, unthinkable 20 years ago. In this review, in relation to the workflow of spectroscopy and/or scattering studies, we summarize progress and challenges in the component areas of electronic structure calculations, PES fitting, and quantum dynamical calculations.},

Dry deposition is driven by turbulence and shows a strong dependence on particle size.

We identify several gaps in the literature, including deposition over the cryosphere (i.e., snow and ice surfaces) and the ocean; in addition, we highlight new techniques to measure black carbon fluxes.

However, many of these techniques were developed for atomic—rather than molecular—paramagnetic species. It has proven challenging to apply some of these experimental methods developed for atoms to paramagnetic molecules. Thanks to the emergence of new experimental approaches and new combinations of existing techniques, the past decade has seen significant progress toward the manipulation and control of paramagnetic molecules. This review identifies the key methods that have been implemented for the state-selective manipulation of paramagnetic molecules—discussing the motivation, state of the art, and future prospects of the field.

To improve the material and morphological universalities, researchers have employed different kinds of nanostructures that have played important roles in the development of SERS technologies. Different strategies, such as so-called borrowing enhancement from shell-isolated modes and shell-isolated nanoparticle-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS)-satellite structures, have been proposed to obtain highly effective Raman enhancement, and these methods make it possible to apply SERS to various electrocatalytic systems.

	abstract = {Because plasmonic metal nanostructures combine strong light absorption with catalytically active surfaces, they have become platforms for the light-assisted catalysis of chemical reactions. The enhancement of reaction rates by plasmonic excitation has been extensively discussed. This review focuses on a less discussed aspect: the induction of new reaction pathways by light excitation. Through commentary on seminal reports, we describe the principles behind the optical modulation of chemical reactivity and selectivity on plasmonic metal nanostructures. Central to these phenomena are excited charge carriers generated by plasmonic excitation, which modify the energy landscape available to surface reactive species and unlock pathways not conventionally available in thermal catalysis. Photogenerated carriers can trigger bond dissociation or desorption in an adsorbate-selective manner, drive charge transfer and multielectron redox reactions, and generate radical intermediates. Through one or more of these mechanisms, a specific pathway becomes favored under light. By improved control over these mechanisms, light-assisted catalysis can be transformational for chemical synthesis and energy conversion.},

We discuss two common VSFG microscopy geometries: wide-field and confocal point-scanning. We then introduce the principle of VSFG and the relationships between hyperspectral imaging with traditional spectroscopy, microscopy, and time-resolved measurements. We further highlight crucial applications of VSFG microscopy in self-assembled monolayers, cellulose in plants, collagen fibers, and lattice self-assembled biomimetic materials. In these systems, VSFG microscopy reveals relationships between physical properties that would otherwise be hidden without being spectrally, spatially, and temporally resolved. Lastly, we discuss the recent development of ultrafast transient VSFG microscopy, which can spatially measure the ultrafast vibrational dynamics of self-assembled materials. The review ends with an outlook on the technical challenges of and scientific potential for VSFG microscopy.},

The combination of the two brings the single-molecule sensitivity and specificity of SR to the detailed cellular context and molecular scale resolution of CET. The resulting correlative data is more informative than the sum of its parts. The correlative images can be used to pinpoint the positions of fluorescently labeled proteins in the high-resolution context of CET with nanometer-scale precision and/or to identify proteins in electron-dense structures. The execution of srCryoCLEM is challenging and the approach is best described as a method that is still in its infancy with numerous technical challenges.

Challenges remain in understanding the impact of aerosols on the climate, atmosphere, and human health. The effect of aerosols depends on their physicochemical properties, such as their hygroscopicity, phase state, and surface tension. These properties are dynamic with respect to the highly variable relative humidity and temperature of the atmosphere. Thus, experimental approaches that permit the measurement of these dynamic properties are required. Such measurements also need to be performed on individual, submicrometer-, and supermicrometer-sized aerosol particles, as individual atmospheric particles from the same source can exhibit great variability in their form and function. In this context, this review focuses on the recent emergence of atomic force microscopy as an experimental tool in physical, analytical, and atmospheric chemistry that enables such measurements.

Electrochemical tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (EC-TERS), which provides molecular fingerprint information with nanometer-scale spatial resolution, is a promising technique for achieving this goal. Since the first demonstration of this technique in 2015, EC-TERS has been developed for characterizing various electrochemical processes at the nanoscale and molecular level. Here, we review the development of EC-TERS over the past 5 years. We discuss progress in addressing the technical challenges, including optimizing the EC-TERS setup and solving tip-related issues, and provide experimental guidelines. We also survey the important applications of EC-TERS for probing molecular protonation, molecular adsorption, electrochemical reactions, and photoelectrochemical reactions.

The first approach utilizes snapshots of chromophore-environment configurations for which chromophore normal modes are determined. We outline various approximations for this static approach that assumes harmonic potentials and ignores dynamic system-environment coupling. The second approach obtains excitation energies for a series of time-correlated snapshots. This dynamic approach relies on the accurate truncation of the cumulant expansion but treats the dynamics of the chromophore and the environment on equal footing. Both approaches show significant potential for making strides toward more accurate optical spectroscopy simulations of complex condensed phase systems.},

While electrostatic interactions play an essential role in the structure, thermodynamics, dynamics, and reactivity of electrode-electrolyte interfaces, these properties also crucially depend on the nature of the ions and solvent, as well as that of the metal itself.

Unlike plasmonic Au nanoparticles, in which collective electron excitation dominates, Au NCs show single-electron transitions and molecule-like exciton dynamics. The size-, shape-, structure-, and composition-dependent dynamics in Au NCs are further discussed in detail. For small-sized Au NCs, strong quantum confinement effects give rise to relaxation dynamics that is significantly dependent on atomic packing, shape, and heteroatom doping. For relatively larger-sized Au NCs, strong size dependence can be observed in exciton and electron dynamics. We also discuss the origin of coherent oscillations and their roles in excited-state relaxation. Finally, we provide our perspective on future directions in this area.},

In Janus bilayer TMDs breaking out-of-plane symmetry causes intrinsic electric field which induces Rashba spin-splitting at the Γ-point in valance band and Zeeman-type spin-splitting at the K-point of both valance band and conduction band. Fifteen different stacking patterns of MoSeTe as an example have been investigated to find the most stable structures and the stacking configurations with Rashba spin-splitting. We have manipulated these spin properties by applying an external electric field parallel to the internal electric field to enhance the strength of it. Furthermore, we have explored the effect of in-plane biaxial strain on the electrical and spin properties of structures. Applying strain can significantly change and control the value of Rashba spin-splitting by modifying the orbitals overlap which can adjust the intrinsic electric field. Finally, our results are helpful in understanding the stacking-dependent Rashba spin-splitting in bilayer Janus transition-metal dichalcogenides and promote the application of bilayer MXY in spintronic applications.},

The reversible stepwise protolytic reactions of the two axially ligated water molecules, as well as four peripheral pyridyl groups at the meso-position of AlTPyP, were characterized using UV–vis absorption spectroscopy, ¹H NMR, fluorescence lifetime measurements, and cyclic voltammetry. The result showed that four-step protolytic equilibrium reactions of the axial ligands proceeded under the basic pH condition and those of meso-substituted pyridyl groups did also under the acidic pH condition. All the nine species are in equilibria in the ground states as characterized with each pKa value. On the other hand, they exist as individual species in the excited states having each single exponential decay time constant. Here we will report the first detailed study on the formation of nine species from a single molecule of AlTPyP through protolytic reactions in the pH range between 0.54 and 12.3.},

Numerical experiments comparing the proposed method with other existing methods which are MATLAB’s functions expm and funm show that our approach is also very effective and reliable for computing the matrix exponential . Moreover, there are two main advantages of our approach. One is that there is no inverse of a matrix required in this method. The other is that this method is more convenient when computing for a fixed matrix A with many t ≥ 0.},

Several of the complexes exhibit moderately high photoluminescence quantum yields in the solid state, with ΦPL of up to 35\%, and in solution, with ΦPL of up to 98\%. We were able to correlate the powder photoluminescence quantum yields with the \% Vbur of the P{\textasciicircum}P ligand. The most emissive complexes were used to fabricate both organic light-emitting diodes and light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs), both of which showed moderate performance. Compared to the benchmark copper(I)-based LECs, [Cu(dnbp)(DPEPhos)]+ (maximum external quantum efficiency, EQEmax = 16\%), complex 3 (EQEmax = 1.85\%) showed a much longer device lifetime (t1/2 = 1.25 h and {\textgreater}16.5 h for [Cu(dnbp)(DPEPhos)]+ and complex 3, respectively). The electrochemiluminescence (ECL) properties of several complexes were also studied, which, to the best of our knowledge, constitutes the first ECL study for heteroleptic copper(I) complexes. Notably, complexes exhibiting more reversible electrochemistry were associated with higher annihilation ECL as well as better performance in a LEC.},

	abstract = {We develop a Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (LPT) framework to study the clustering of cold dark matter (CDM) in cosmologies with massive neutrinos. We follow the trajectories of CDM particles with Lagrangian displacements fields up to third order in perturbation theory. Once the neutrinos become non-relativistic, their density fluctuations are modeled as being proportional to the CDM density fluctuations, with a scale-dependent proportionality factor. This yields a gravitational back-reaction that introduces additional scales to the linear growth function, which is accounted for in the higher order LPT kernels. Through non-linear mappings from Eulerian to Lagrangian frames, we ensure that our theory has a well behaved large scale behavior free of unwanted UV divergences, which are common when neutrino and CDM densities are not treated on an equal footing, and in resummation schemes that manifestly break Galilean invariance. We use our theory to construct correlation functions for both the underlying matter field, as well as for biased tracers using Convolution-LPT. Redshift-space distortions effects are modeled using the Gaussian Streaming Model. When comparing our analytical results to simulated data from the \textsc{Quijote} simulation suite, we find good accuracy down to r=20 Mpc h−1 at redshift z=0.5, for the real space and redshift space monopole particle correlation functions with no free parameters. The same accuracy is reached for the redshift space quadrupole if we additionally consider an effective field theory parameter that shifts the pairwise velocity dispersion. For modeling the correlation functions of tracers we adopt a simple Lagrangian biasing scheme with only density and curvature operators, which we find sufficient to reach down to r=20 Mpc h−1 when comparing to simulated halos.},

The copper centers in the molecular structure are bridged by two thiocyanate anions and each Cu(I) is chelated further terminally by a PPh2PAr2 ligand. The [Cu(μ-SCN)2Cu] cores have essential planar configurations. In the solid state, the complex exhibits blue photoluminescence with emission peaks λmax = 478 nm (1), lifetimes 4.7 μs and quantum yields (φ = 0.43) at room temperature. The studies of varied temperature emission spectra and decay behaviours of the complex indicate that it displays thermally activated delayed fluorescence at room temperature. The results of the experimental and DFT calculations suggest that the emission in the solid state originates from the 1,3MLCT excited states.},

	abstract = {A small molecular weight cationic copper(I) complex showing high luminescence quantum yield based on a thermally activated delayed fluorescence mechanism is immobilized between two 1 nm thin silicate layers. Partial ion exchange of the emitter into a synthetic layered silicate (fluorohectorite) yields an ordered heterostructure with two types of strictly alternating interlayers: a monolayer of the cationic emitter and a monolayer of hydrated Na+ cations. Osmotic swelling of the latter produces dispersions of double‐stacks in which the emitter monolayer is encapsulated between two silicate layers. The electrostatic attraction of the emitter interlayer with the oppositely charged silicate layers exerts electrostatic pressure on the emitter. Compared to crystalline salt, rigid confinement for the encapsulated emitter provides improved thermal stability and increased emission quantum yield at ambient temperature. The suspension of delaminated, micrometer‐sized double‐stacks of 3.9 nm thickness allows for easy solution processing of low‐cost optoelectronic devices, such as light‐emitting electrochemical cells and organic light‐emitting diodes. Encapsulation of thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitter improves thermal stability and increases luminescence quantum yields at ambient temperature. Synthesis route involves delamination of regularly ordered interstratifications yielding dispersible double‐stacks of densely packed emitter interlayers encapsulated between silicate layers. Immobilization of low molecular weight emitters enables the application of luminescent compounds suitable for optoelectronic devices preventing their diffusion across the device.},

The proposed FDM decomposes any data to a small number of 'Fourier intrinsic band functions' (FIBFs). The FDM presents a generalized Fourier expansion with variable amplitudes and variable frequencies of a time series by the Fourier method itself. We propose an idea of zero-phase filter bank-based multivariate FDM (MFDM), for the alysis of multivariate nonlinear and non-stationary time series, using the FDM. We also present an algorithm to obtain cut-off frequencies for MFDM. The proposed MFDM generates a finite number of bandited multivariate FIBFs (MFIBFs). The MFDM preserves some intrinsic physical properties of the multivariate data, such as scale alignment, trend and instantaneous frequency. The proposed methods provide a time–frequency–energy (TFE) distribution that reveals the intrinsic structure of a data.

The experimental results show that the improved ant colony algorithm achieves good results both in optimal path solution and in dynamic coastal travel route planning.

To acquire a fast reconstruction that does not require an online inverse process, the nonuniform fast Fourier transform (NFFT), also called convolutional gridding, is frequently employed. While various investigations have led to improvements in accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the NFFT, not much attention has been paid to the fundamental analysis of the scheme, and in particular its convergence properties. This paper analyzes the convergence of the NFFT by casting it as a Fourier frame approximation. In so doing, we are able to design parameters for the method that satisfy conditions for numerical convergence. Our so-called frame theoretic convolutional gridding algorithm can also be applied to detect features (such as edges) from nonuniform Fourier samples of piecewise smooth functions.},

Our algorithm applies to any number of continuous variables (Laplace transforms) and discrete variables (generating functions). We use the Fourier-series method; that is, the inversion formula is the Fourier series of a periodic function constructed by aliasing. This amounts to an application of the Poisson summation formula. By appropriately exponentially damping the given function, we control the aliasing error. We choose the periods of the multidimensional periodic function so that each infinite series is a finite sum of nearly alternating infinite series. Then we apply the Euler transformation to compute the infinite series from finitely many terms. The multidimensional inversion algorithm enables us, evidently for the first time, to calculate probability distributions quickly and accurately from several classical transforms in queueing theory. For example, we apply our algorithm to invert the two-dimensional transforms of the joint distribution of the duration of a busy period and the number served in that busy period, and the time-dependent transient queue-length and workload distributions in the M/G/1 queue. In other related work, we have applied the inversion algorithms here to calculate time-dependent distributions in the transient BMAP/G/1 queue (with a batch Markovian arrival process) and the piecewise-stationary Mt/Gt/1 queue.},

The clock cycle in the filter is controlled by the distributed algorithm. The experimental results show that the optimization design of this method is correct and the expected goal is realized.},

	abstract = {The formal representation of the quasi-periodic Helmholtz Green's function obtained by the method of images is only conditionally convergent and, thus, requires an appropriate summation convention for its evaluation. Instead of using this formal sum, we derive a candidate Green's function as a sum of two rapidly convergent series, one to be applied in the spatial domain and the other in the Fourier domain (as in Ewald's method). We prove that this representation of Green's function satisfies the Helmholtz equation with the quasi-periodic condition and, furthermore, leads to a fast algorithm for its application as an operator. We approximate the spatial series by a short sum of separable functions given by Gaussians in each variable. For the series in the Fourier domain, we exploit the exponential decay of its terms to truncate it. We use fast and accurate algorithms for convolving functions with this approximation of the quasi-periodic Green's function. The resulting method yields a fast solver for the Helmholtz equation with the quasi-periodic boundary condition. The algorithm is adaptive in the spatial domain and its performance does not significantly deteriorate when Green's function is applied to discontinuous functions or potentials with singularities. We also construct Helmholtz Green's functions with Dirichlet, Neumann or mixed boundary conditions on simple domains and use a modification of the fast algorithm for the quasi-periodic Green's function to apply them. The complexity, in dimension d≥2, of these algorithms is \$\{{\textbackslash}cal O\}({\textbackslash}kappa {\textasciicircum}\{d\}{\textbackslash}text\{log\}{\textbackslash}kappa +C({\textbackslash}text\{log\}{\textbackslash}epsilon {\textasciicircum}\{-1\}){\textasciicircum}\{d\})\$, where ε is the desired accuracy, κ is proportional to the number of wavelengths contained in the computational domain and C is a constant. We illustrate our approach with examples.},

Bredihina established an analogous result for functions belonging to the Stepanov space of almost periodic functions S 2 whose Fourier exponents satisfy a natural separation condition. Here, the maximal operators corresponding to lacunary partial summation of almost periodic Fourier series are shown to be bounded on the Stepanov spaces \$S{\textasciicircum}\{2{\textasciicircum}\{k\}\}\$ , k ∈ ℕ, for functions satisfying the same condition; Bredihina's result follows as a consequence. In the process of establishing these bounds, some general results are obtained which will facilitate further work on operator bounds and convergence issues in Stepanov spaces. These include a boundedness theorem for the Hilbert transform and a theorem of Littlewood–Paley type. An improvement of " \$S{\textasciicircum}\{2{\textasciicircum}\{k\}\}\$ , k ∈ ℕ" to "S p , p ∈ (1, ∞)" is also seen to follow from a natural conjecture on the boundedness of the Hilbert transform.},

comparison is made with other existing methods from the literature. From these results, it can be

Here, we report a study of a neutral oxygen vacancy in TiO2 using state-of-the-art quantum chemical electronic structure methods. We find that the ground state is a color center singlet state in both the rutile and the anatase phases of TiO2. Specifically, embedded coupled cluster with singles, doubles, and perturbative triples calculations find, for an oxygen vacancy in rutile, that the lowest triplet state energy is 0.6 eV above the singlet state, and in anatase, the triplet state energy is higher by 1.4 eV. Our study provides fresh insights into the electronic structure of the oxygen vacancy in TiO2, clarifying earlier controversies and potentially inspiring future studies of defects with correlated wave function theories.},

In addition to showing that this excited state ansatz is sufficiently close to a mean field product state to admit a one-electron formulation, this approach brings the orbital optimization speed to within roughly a factor of two of ground state mean field theory. The approach parallels Hartree Fock theory in multiple ways, including the presence of a commutator condition, a one-electron mean-field working equation, and acceleration via direct inversion in the iterative subspace. When combined with a configuration interaction singles Davidson solver for the excitation coefficients, the self-consistent field formulation dramatically reduces the cost of the theory compared to previous approaches based on quasi-Newton descent.},

While spin–phonon coupling is recognized as an important determinant of these dynamics, additional fundamental studies are required to unravel the nature of the coupling and, thus, leverage it in molecular engineering approaches. To this end, we describe here a combined ligand field theory and multireference ab initio model to define spin–phonon coupling terms in S = 2 transition metal complexes and demonstrate how couplings originate from both the static and dynamic properties of ground and excited states. By extending concepts to spin conversion processes, ligand field dynamics manifest in the evolution of the excited state origins of zero-field splitting (ZFS) along specific normal mode potential energy surfaces. Dynamic ZFSs provide a powerful means to independently evaluate contributions from spin-allowed and/or spin-forbidden excited states to spin–phonon coupling terms. Furthermore, ratios between various intramolecular coupling terms for a given mode drive spin conversion processes in transition metal complexes and can be used to analyze the mechanisms of ISC. Variations in geometric structure strongly influence the relative intramolecular linear spin–phonon coupling terms and will define the overall spin state dynamics. While the findings of this study are of general importance for understanding magnetization dynamics, they also link the phenomenon of spin–phonon coupling across fields of single molecule magnetism, quantum materials/qubits, and transition metal photophysics.},

These approaches are often the basis for understanding many fundamental condensed phase processes, including the molecular mechanisms underlying solar energy harvesting and photocatalysis. Despite the importance of these effective particles, there is still a need for computational methods that can explore their behavior on chemically relevant length and time scales. This is especially true when the interactions between the particles and their environment are important. We introduce an approach for studying quasiparticles in condensed phases by combining effective mass theory with the path integral treatment of quantum particles. This framework incorporates the generally anisotropic electronic band structure of materials into path integral simulation schemes to enable modeling of quasiparticles in quantum confinement, for example. We demonstrate the utility of effective mass path integral simulations by modeling an exciton in solid potassium chloride and electron trapping by a sulfur vacancy in monolayer molybdenum disulfide.},

	abstract = {Inspired by molecular crystal theory of coupling symmetry-related transition dipole moments, we develop a model for rational design of Cu(I) complexes to achieve short TADF (thermally activated delayed fluorescence) decay times. This is, for example, important to reduce OLED stability problems and roll-off effects. Guided by the model, we design a new class of Cu(I) dimers focusing on Cu2(tppb)(PPh3)2Cl2 2 (tppb(PPh3)2 = 1,2,4,5-tetrakis(diphenylphosphino)benzene). Indeed, this class of compounds shows particularly short TADF decay times as evidenced by luminescence studies over a temperature range of 1.5 K ≤ T ≤ 300 K and thus, supports the proposed design strategy. The model is further supported by TD-DFT calculations. A key property of the strategy is that the new dimer(s) exhibit a drastically faster radiative rate of the transition between the lowest excited singlet state and the ground state than the related monomer, Cu(dppb)(PPh3)Cl 1 (dppb = 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)benzene). This is even valid at a small singlet-triplet energy gap of △E(S1-T1) = 390 cm-1 (48 meV). Accordingly, we find a benchmark TADF decay time for the Cu(I) dimer 2 of only 1.2 μs (radiative decay: 1.5 μs). This a factor of about three times shorter than found so far for any other Cu(I) complex with similarly small energy gap. The presented design strategy seems to be of general validity.},

An intense red luminescence appeared when the Pt(II)-complex immobilised BPy-PMO was exposed to methanol vapour and disappeared on exposure to pyridine vapour. The ON-OFF vapochromic behaviour occurred repeatedly in a methanol/pyridine/heating cycle. Interestingly, a rapid response was achieved in the second cycle and cycles thereafter. Scanning and transmission electron microscopies (SEM/TEM), absorption and emission, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies, mass spectrometry, and powder X-ray diffraction indicated that methanol vapour induced Si-C cleavage and thus liberated [Pt(ppy)(bpy)]Cl (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine) from the BPy-PMO framework. Furthermore, the self-assembling properties of the Pt(II) complex resulted in the formation of highly luminescent micro/nanocrystals that were homogeneously dispersed on the porous support. The unique vapoluminescence triggered by the unprecedented protodesilylation on exposure to protic solvent vapour at room temperature is attributable to BPy-PMO being a giant ligand and an effective vapour condenser.

	abstract = {An efficient solvent-assistant mechanochemical synthesis of a bright TADF-emitting CuI–based compound that is inaccessible by conventional wet methods, is reported for the first time. The simple manual grinding of 2-(ethylsulfanyl)-6-methylpyridine (L) with CuI in the presence of a few drops of MeCN for 1–2 min chemoselectively gives the 1-D coordination polymer (CP), [Cu3I3L2]n (CP1) as a single product isolated in 87\% yield. Under solvent-free conditions or in solution, this reaction results in non-emissive complex, [Cu2I2L2] (C1) or structurally different 1-D CP, [Cu3I3L2]n (CP3), respectively. Remarkably, both C1 and CP3 under the mechanochemical conditions easily (1–2 min) undergo polymerization or isomerisation, accordingly, to afford CP1. The structure of the latter is formed by cuprophilic interactions-free (–Cu–I–)n chains ligated by 2-(ethylsulfanyl)-6-methylpyridines in a μ2-N,S manner. At room temperature, CP1 exhibits highly efficient blue-green TADF with short lifetime (4.0 μs) and high photoluminescence performance (PLQY being 70\%).},

The copper complexes are phosphorescent in the orange-red region of the spectrum in the solid-state under ambient conditions. Structural characterization in solution and the solid-state reveals a flexible conformational landscape, with both diamond-like and butterfly motifs available to the Cu2X2 cores. Comparing the photophysical properties of complexes of (quinolinyl)phosphine ligands with those of π-extended (phenanthridinyl)phosphines has revealed a counterintuitive impact of site-selective benzannulation. Contrary to conventional assumptions regarding π-extension and a bathochromic shift in the lowest energy absorption maxima, a blue shift of nearly 40 nm in the emission wavelength is observed for the complexes with larger ligand π-systems, which is assigned as phosphorescence on the basis of emission energies and lifetimes. Comparison of the ground-state and triplet excited state structures optimized from DFT and TD-DFT calculations allows attribution of this effect to a greater rigidity for the benzannulated complexes resulting in a higher energy emissive triplet state, rather than significant perturbation of orbital energies. This study reveals that ligand structure can impact photophysical properties for emissive molecules by influencing their structural rigidity, in addition to their electronic structure.},

	abstract = {Using printed organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) for lighting, smart-packaging and other mass-market applications has remained a dream since the first working OLED devices were demonstrated in the late 1980s. The realization of this long-term goal is hindered by the very low abundance of iridium and problems when using low-cost wet chemical production processes. Abundant, solution-processable Cu(I) complexes promise to lower the cost of OLEDs. A new copper iodide NHetPHOS emitter was prepared and characterized in solid state with photoluminescence spectroscopy and UV photoelectron spectroscopy under ambient conditions. The photoluminescence quantum efficiency was determined as 92 ± 5 \% in a thin film with yellowish-green emission centered around 550 nm. This puts the material on par with the most efficient copper complexes known so far. The new compound showed superior solubility in non-polar solvents, which allowed for the fabrication of an inkjet-printed OLED device from a decalin-based ink formulation. The emission layer could be processed under ambient conditions and was annealed under air. In a very simple stack architecture, efficiency values up to 45 cd A−1 corresponding to 13.9 ± 1.9 \% EQE were achieved. These promising results open the door to printed, large-scale OLED devices with abundant copper emitters.},

Conversely, copper complexes are a blooming field of research in (photo) polymerization due to their low cost, easy syntheses, long-living excited state lifetimes, and their remarkable chemical and photochemical stabilities. Copper complexes can also be synthesized in solution and by mechanochemistry, paving the way towards the synthesis of photoinitiators by Green synthetic approaches. In this review, an overview of the different copper complexes reported to date is presented.

For comparison, a D–π–A type sensitizer with one donor group (CD4) is synthesized as well. We have performed a combined experimental and theoretical investigation of their optical, electrochemical, photovoltaic, geometrical and electronic characteristics. These new Y-shaped dyes display intensive UV–vis absorption with high molar extinction coefficients. So their roles as co-sensitizers for ruthenium-based DSSCs are further evaluated. As a consequence, the co-sensitized devices exhibit improved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in the range of 7.24–7.96\% due to the enhanced short-circuit photocurrents (Jsc) and open-circuit voltages (Voc), which are higher than the DSSCs sensitized with N719 (PCE = 6.75\%) or Z907 (PCE = 6.55\%) alone. In addition, the mechanisms of these improvements have been elucidated by incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies. The Jsc is improved because CD1–3 can compensate for the photocurrent loss by I−/I3−; while the Voc is enhanced because the electron recombination process is retarded by these Y-shaped dyes upon co-sensitization.},

- spacers: 6-(2,2'-bipyridin-6-yl)hexanoic acid (1), 6-(5-phenylpentyl)-2,2'-bipyridine (2) and 6-[2-(4-phenyl-1H-1,2,3,triazol-1-yl)ethyl]-2,2'-bipyridine (3). [Cu(POP)(1)][PF6], [Cu(xantphos)(1)][PF6], [Cu(POP)(2)][PF6], [Cu(xantphos)(2)][PF6], and [Cu(xantphos)(3)][PF6] have been characterized in solution using multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, and the single crystal structure of [Cu(xantphos)(3)][PF6]
.
0.5Et2O was determined. The conformation of the 6-[2-(4-phenyl-1H-1,2,3,triazol-1-yl)ethyl]-substituent in the [Cu(xantphos)(3)]+ cation is such that the α- and β-CH2 units reside in the xanthene 'bowl' of the xantphos ligand. The 6-substituent desymmetrizes the structure of the [Cu(P{\textasciicircum}P)(N{\textasciicircum}N)]+ cation and this has consequences for the interpretation of the solution NMR spectra of the five complexes. The NOESY spectra and EXSY cross-peaks provide insight into the dynamic processes operating in the different compounds. For powdered samples, emission maxima are in the range 542-555 nm and photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) lie in the range 13-28\%, and a comparison of PLQYs and decay lifetimes with those of [Cu(xantphos)(6-Mebpy)][PF6] indicate that the introduction of the 6-substituent is not detrimental in terms of the photophysical properties.},

	abstract = {Resummation methods can significantly improve the accuracy of ab initio electronic structure computations without increasing the computational cost. For perturbation theories, resummation methods can be designed by constructing approximants to model the known singularity structure of the theory in the complex plane of the perturbation parameter. Quadratic approximants for the fourth-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory (MP4) greatly improve the accuracy for the ground-state energy and provide information about singularity positions that can be used to select an optimal summation method. The Coupled cluster theories CCSD (coupled clusters with single and double excitations), CCSDT (with triple excitations), CCSDTQ (with quadruple excitations), and CCSD(T) (with a triples correction from perturbation theory) can be resummed using approximants that model the empirically observed convergence patterns of the Hartree–Fock (HF), CCSD, CCSD(T) and HF, CCSD, CCSDT, CCSDTQ sequences. Coupling-constant perturbation theories of molecular vibration and of atoms in external fields, and semiclassical perturbation theories also benefit from appropriate approximants. © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.

In this scope, a unique computational decomposition into a fracture flow and a poro-elastic domain is developed, where communication and numerical coupling of the individual solvers are realized by consulting the open-source library preCICE. The underlying physical problem is introduced by a brief derivation of the governing equations and interface conditions of fracture flow and poro-elastic domain followed by a detailed discussion of the partitioned coupling scheme. We evaluate the proposed implementation and undertake a convergence study to compare a classical interface quasi-Newton inverse least-squares (IQN-ILS) with the more advanced interface quasi-Newton inverse multi-vector Jacobian (IQN-IMVJ) method. These coupling approaches are verified for an academic test case before the generality of the proposed strategy is demonstrated by simulations of two complex fracture networks. In contrast to the development of specific solvers, we promote the simplicity and computational efficiency of the proposed partitioned coupling approach using preCICE and FEniCS for parallel computations of hydro-mechanical processes in complex, three-dimensional fracture networks.},

One of these methods, quantum-electrodynamical density-functional theory (QEDFT), promises computationally efficient calculations for large correlated light-matter systems with the quality of the calculation depending on the underlying approximation for the exchange-correlation functional. So far no true density-functional approximation has been introduced limiting the efficient application of the theory. In this paper, we introduce the first gradient-based density functional for the QEDFT exchange-correlation energy derived from the adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation theorem. We benchmark this simple-to-implement approximation on small systems in optical cavities and demonstrate its relatively low computational costs for fullerene molecules up to C\$\_\{180\}\$ coupled to 400,000 photon modes in a dissipative optical cavity. This work now makes first principle calculations of much larger systems possible within the QEDFT framework effectively combining quantum optics with large-scale electronic structure theory.},

We demonstrate that the NOLSM method, which is at the center point of each AIMD step, is able to achieve a sustained performance of 324 PFLOP/s in mixed FP16/FP32 precision corresponding to an efficiency of 67.7{\textbackslash}\% when running on 1536 NVIDIA A100 GPUs.},

The theory predicts that the different charged leptons, the electron, muon and tau, have identical electroweak interaction strengths. Previous measurements have shown a wide range of particle decays are consistent with this principle of lepton universality. This article presents evidence for the breaking of lepton universality in beauty-quark decays, with a significance of 3.1 standard deviations, based on proton-proton collision data collected with the LHCb detector at CERN's Large Hadron Collider. The measurements are of processes in which a beauty meson transforms into a strange meson with the emission of either an electron and a positron, or a muon and an antimuon. If confirmed by future measurements, this violation of lepton universality would imply physics beyond the Standard Model, such as a new fundamental interaction between quarks and leptons.},

Lett. 92, 193002 (2004)] is extended to the computation of higher order static response properties. Although generally applicable, perturbed projection is developed here in the context of the self-consistent first and second electric hyperpolar-izabilities of three dimensional water clusters at the Hartree-Fock level of theory. Non-orthogonal, density matrix analogues of Wigner's 2n + 1 rule are given up to fourth order. Linear scaling and locality of the higher order response densities under perturbation by a global electric field are demonstrated.},

The method is based on the density matrix perturbation theory [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 193001 (2004)]], obtaining response functions directly via a perturbative approach to spectral projection. The accuracy and efficiency of the linear scaling method is demonstrated for a series of three-dimensional water clusters at the RHF/6-31G(**) level of theory.

	abstract = {An implicit purification scheme is proposed for calculation of the temperature-dependent, grand canonical single-particle density matrix, given as a Fermi operator expansion in terms of the Hamiltonian. The computational complexity is shown to scale with the logarithm of the polynomial order of the expansion, or equivalently, with the logarithm of the inverse temperature. The system of linear equations that arise in each implicit purification iteration is solved efficiently by a conjugate gradient solver. The scheme is particularly useful in connection with linear scaling electronic structure theory based on sparse matrix algebra. The efficiency of the implicit temperature expansion technique is analyzed and compared to some explicit purification methods for the zero temperature density matrix. Comment: 4 pages, 2 figures},

	volume = {7},
	doi = {10.1021/ct2001705},
	abstract = {As it stands, density matrix purification is a powerful tool for linear scaling electronic structure calculations. The convergence is rapid and depends only weakly on the band gap. However, as will be shown in this paper, there is room for improvements. The key is to allow for non-monotonicity in the recursive polynomial expansion. Based on this idea, new purification schemes are proposed that require only half the number of matrix-matrix multiplications compared to previous schemes. The speedup is essentially independent of the location of the chemical potential and increases with decreasing band gap.},

The response equations are solved iteratively, by an atomic-orbital subspace method equivalent to that of molecular-orbital theory. Important features of the subspace method are the use of paired trial vectors (to preserve the algebraic structure of the response equations), a nondiagonal preconditioner (for rapid convergence), and the generation of good initial guesses (for robust solution). As a result, the performance of the iterative method is the same as in canonical molecular-orbital theory, with five to ten iterations needed for convergence. As in traditional direct Hartree-Fock and Kohn-Sham theories, the calculations are dominated by the construction of the effective Fock/Kohn-Sham matrix, once in each iteration. Linear complexity is achieved by using sparse-matrix algebra, as illustrated in calculations of excitation energies and frequency-dependent polarizabilities of polyalanine peptides containing up to 1400 atoms.},

The first method is a straightforward application of Newton's method for the optimization of nonlinear functions, modified so as to ensure global convergence. The second method is based on the solution of an eigenvalue equation which reduces to the standard eigenvalue problem of CI theory when no orbital optimization is included. The chapter discusses how these linear equations are solved for large MCSCF expansions, and introduces an exponential unitary parametrization of the configuration space. The triplet and singlet instabilities occur when RHF wave functions are used to describe the breaking of chemical bonds.},

	abstract = {A new scheme for obtaining first-order nonadiabatic coupling matrix elements (FO-NACME) for multiconfigurational self-consistent-field (MCSCF) wave functions is presented. The FO-NACME are evaluated from residues of linear response functions. The residues involve the geometrical response of a reference MCSCF wave function and the excitation vectors of response theory. Advantages of the method are that the reference state is fully optimized and that the excited states, represented by the excitation vectors, are strictly orthogonal to each other and to the reference state. In a single calculation the FO-NACME between the reference state and several excited states may be obtained simultaneously. The method is most well suited to describe situations where the dominant configurations for the two states differ mainly by a single electron replacement. When the dominant configurations differ by two electrons many correlating orbitals are required in the MCSCF reference state calculation to accurately describe the FO-NACME. FO-NACME between various states of H2, MgH2, and BH are presented. These calculations show that the method is capable of giving quantitatively correct results that converge to the full configuration interaction limit. Comparisons are made with state-averaged MCSCF results for MgH2 and finite-difference configuration interaction by perturbation with multi-configurational zeroth-order wave function reflected by interactive process (CIPSI) results for BH.},

We confirm previous findings that, except for systems with large static correlation effects, the effect of correlation on molecular magnetizabilities is small. A somewhat larger correlation contribution is usually observed for the rotational g tensor, although this property is also rather insensitive to the correlation treatment. Agreement with experimental rotational g tensors is only fair and estimates of rovibrational corrections are needed to assess properly the accuracy of theoretically calculated rotational g tensors.},

	abstract = {Inspired by molecular crystal theory of coupling symmetry-related transition dipole moments, we develop a model for rational design of Cu(I) complexes to achieve short TADF (thermally activated delayed fluorescence) decay times. This is, for example, important to reduce OLED stability problems and roll-off effects. Guided by the model, we design a new class of Cu(I) dimers focusing on Cu2(tppb)(PPh3)2Cl2 2 (tppb(PPh3)2 = 1,2,4,5-tetrakis(diphenylphosphino)benzene). Indeed, this class of compounds shows particularly short TADF decay times as evidenced by luminescence studies over a temperature range of 1.5 K ≤ T ≤ 300 K and, thus, supports the proposed design strategy. The model is further supported by TD-DFT calculations. A key property of the strategy is that the new dimer(s) exhibit a drastically faster radiative rate of the transition between the lowest excited singlet state and the ground state than the related monomer, Cu(dppb)(PPh3)Cl 1 (dppb = 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)benzene). This is even valid at a small singlet–triplet energy gap of ΔE(S1–T1) = 390 cm–1 (48 meV). Accordingly, we find a benchmark TADF decay time for the Cu(I) dimer 2 of only 1.2 μs (radiative decay: 1.5 μs). This is a factor of about three times shorter than found so far for any other Cu(I) complex with a similarly small energy gap. The presented design strategy seems to be of general validity.},

	abstract = {A new series of tetrahedral heteroleptic copper(I) complexes exhibiting efficient thermally-activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) in green to orange electromagnetic spectral regions has been developed by using D-A type N{\textasciicircum}N ligand and P{\textasciicircum}P ligands. Their structures, electrochemical, photophysical, and electroluminescence properties have been characterized. The complexes exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of up to 0.71 at room temperature in doped film and the lifetimes are in a wide range of 4.3–24.1 μs. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the complexes reveal the lowest-lying intraligand charge-transfer excited states that are localized on the N{\textasciicircum}N ligands. Solution-processed organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on one of the new emitters show a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 7.96\%.},

The input is the perturbative expansion of the relevant S-matrix element in powers of a renormalized coupling constant. The method reproduces the lower perturbative terms and gives an extrapolation of the higher ones, which is appropriate in the high-energy region. In the framework of the phi/sup 4/ model, the total cross-section, the ratio of the real to the imaginary part of the elastic two-body scattering amplitude and the elastic differential cross-section are calculated. The results show some general features of the two-body high-energy hadronic collisions.},

This “complex-plane” MWA, effected via a linear-path detour in the complex plane, results in rapid, absolute convergence of field and potential solutions in multi-layered environments regardless of the source-observer geometry and anisotropy/loss of the media present. In this work, we first introduce a new integration path used to evaluate the field contribution arising from the radiation spectra. Subsequently, we (1) exhibit the foundational relations behind the complex-plane extension to a general Levin-type sequence convergence accelerator, (2) specialize this analysis to one member of the Levin transform family (the MWA), (3) address and circumvent restrictions, arising for two-dimensional integrals associated with wave dynamics problems, through minimal complex-plane detour restrictions and a novel partition of the integration domain, (4) develop and compare two formulations based on standard/real-axis MWA variants, and (5) present validation results and convergence characteristics for one of these two formulations.},

	abstract = {We have calculated 200 lower vibrational energy levels of the formaldehyde molecule using ab initio quartic force field, high-order Rayleigh–Schrödinger perturbation theory (up to 200th order) and algebraic Hermit–Padé approximants (up to sixth degree) to sum up divergent perturbation series, corresponding to each vibrational state. Both energy levels and algebraic Hermit–Padé approximants are, in fact, multivalued functions and consist of several branches. We find that branches of the approximant constructed using coefficients of the perturbation series for a particular vibrational state can reproduce not only the energy of this state, but also of other states which are close in energy to the considered one and are coupled with them by anharmonic resonances. The multivalued property of algebraic approximants has been previously demonstrated by Jordan in the case of two-state avoided crossings of the potential energy curves of diatomic molecules (Jordan 1975 Int. J. Quantum Chem. 9 325) and by Fernandez and Diaz in the case of one-dimensional periodic eigenvalue problems (Fernandéz and Diaz 2001 Eur. Phys. J. D 15 41). This paper extends the study of this nontrivial property of perturbation theory to the vibrational states of polyatomic molecules, a problem with many dimensions. Additionally, we have found that this property is useful in some special cases when perturbation series diverges so fast that most high-order approximants do not reproduce the correct value of the energy with the required accuracy.},

To acquire a fast reconstruction that does not require an online inverse process, the nonuniform fast Fourier transform (NFFT), also called convolutional gridding, is frequently employed. While various investigations have led to improvements in accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the NFFT, not much attention has been paid to the fundamental analysis of the scheme, and in particular its convergence properties. This paper analyzes the convergence of the NFFT by casting it as a Fourier frame approximation. In so doing, we are able to design parameters for the method that satisfy conditions for numerical convergence. Our so-called frame theoretic convolutional gridding algorithm can also be applied to detect features (such as edges) from nonuniform Fourier samples of piecewise smooth functions.},

Our algorithm applies to any number of continuous variables (Laplace transforms) and discrete variables (generating functions). We use the Fourier-series method; that is, the inversion formula is the Fourier series of a periodic function constructed by aliasing. This amounts to an application of the Poisson summation formula. By appropriately exponentially damping the given function, we control the aliasing error. We choose the periods of the multidimensional periodic function so that each infinite series is a finite sum of nearly alternating infinite series. Then we apply the Euler transformation to compute the infinite series from finitely many terms. The multidimensional inversion algorithm enables us, evidently for the first time, to calculate probability distributions quickly and accurately from several classical transforms in queueing theory. For example, we apply our algorithm to invert the two-dimensional transforms of the joint distribution of the duration of a busy period and the number served in that busy period, and the time-dependent transient queue-length and workload distributions in the M/G/1 queue. In other related work, we have applied the inversion algorithms here to calculate time-dependent distributions in the transient BMAP/G/1 queue (with a batch Markovian arrival process) and the piecewise-stationary Mt/Gt/1 queue.},

We propose a nonequispaced hyperbolic cross FFT based on one hyperbolic cross FFT and a dedicated interpolation by splines on sparse grids. Analogously to the nonequispaced FFT for trigonometric polynomials with Fourier coefficients supported on the full grid, this allows for the efficient evaluation of trigonometric polynomials with Fourier coefficients supported on the hyperbolic cross at arbitrary spatial sampling nodes.},

	abstract = {The formal representation of the quasi-periodic Helmholtz Green's function obtained by the method of images is only conditionally convergent and, thus, requires an appropriate summation convention for its evaluation. Instead of using this formal sum, we derive a candidate Green's function as a sum of two rapidly convergent series, one to be applied in the spatial domain and the other in the Fourier domain (as in Ewald's method). We prove that this representation of Green's function satisfies the Helmholtz equation with the quasi-periodic condition and, furthermore, leads to a fast algorithm for its application as an operator. We approximate the spatial series by a short sum of separable functions given by Gaussians in each variable. For the series in the Fourier domain, we exploit the exponential decay of its terms to truncate it. We use fast and accurate algorithms for convolving functions with this approximation of the quasi-periodic Green's function. The resulting method yields a fast solver for the Helmholtz equation with the quasi-periodic boundary condition. The algorithm is adaptive in the spatial domain and its performance does not significantly deteriorate when Green's function is applied to discontinuous functions or potentials with singularities. We also construct Helmholtz Green's functions with Dirichlet, Neumann or mixed boundary conditions on simple domains and use a modification of the fast algorithm for the quasi-periodic Green's function to apply them. The complexity, in dimension d≥2, of these algorithms is \$\{{\textbackslash}cal O\}({\textbackslash}kappa {\textasciicircum}\{d\}{\textbackslash}text\{log\}{\textbackslash}kappa +C({\textbackslash}text\{log\}{\textbackslash}epsilon {\textasciicircum}\{-1\}){\textasciicircum}\{d\})\$, where ε is the desired accuracy, κ is proportional to the number of wavelengths contained in the computational domain and C is a constant.

	abstract = {In this article, we derive a series expansion of the multivariate normal probability integrals based on Fourier series. The basic idea is to transform the limits of each integral from hi to ∞ to be from −∞ to ∞ by multiplying the integrand by a periodic square wave that approximates the domain of the integral. This square wave is expressed by its Fourier series expansion. Then a Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix is applied to transform the integrand to a simple one that can be easily evaluated. The resultant formula has a simple pattern that is expressed as multiple series expansion of trigonometric and exponential functions.},

Bredihina established an analogous result for functions belonging to the Stepanov space of almost periodic functions S 2 whose Fourier exponents satisfy a natural separation condition. Here, the maximal operators corresponding to lacunary partial summation of almost periodic Fourier series are shown to be bounded on the Stepanov spaces \$S{\textasciicircum}\{2{\textasciicircum}\{k\}\}\$ , k ∈ ℕ, for functions satisfying the same condition; Bredihina's result follows as a consequence. In the process of establishing these bounds, some general results are obtained which will facilitate further work on operator bounds and convergence issues in Stepanov spaces. These include a boundedness theorem for the Hilbert transform and a theorem of Littlewood–Paley type. An improvement of " \$S{\textasciicircum}\{2{\textasciicircum}\{k\}\}\$ , k ∈ ℕ" to "S p , p ∈ (1, ∞)" is also seen to follow from a natural conjecture on the boundedness of the Hilbert transform.},

The proposed FDM decomposes any data to a small number of 'Fourier intrinsic band functions' (FIBFs). The FDM presents a generalized Fourier expansion with variable amplitudes and variable frequencies of a time series by the Fourier method itself. We propose an idea of zero-phase filter bank-based multivariate FDM (MFDM), for the alysis of multivariate nonlinear and non-stationary time series, using the FDM. We also present an algorithm to obtain cut-off frequencies for MFDM. The proposed MFDM generates a finite number of bandited multivariate FIBFs (MFIBFs). The MFDM preserves some intrinsic physical properties of the multivariate data, such as scale alignment, trend and instantaneous frequency. The proposed methods provide a time–frequency–energy (TFE) distribution that reveals the intrinsic structure of a data.

Anharmonic vibrational states of HOF were calculated by the matrix configuration interaction (VCI) method, the second-order Van Vleck operator perturbation theory (CVPT2), and the high-order RSPT series. CVPT2 predicts a weak Fermi resonance (0,1,–2) and a medium second-order resonance (1,–2,–1). Resummation of the high-order (λn,0≤n≤203) divergent RSPT series, using multivalued quartic 40-th degree Padé-Hermite diagonal approximants up to terms O(λn+1) for a subset of low-lying states, restored their correct energies. Considering λ as a complex parameter, solution branch points were found as roots of discriminant polynomials. The coincidence of dominant branch points for pairs of states according to the Katz theorem and the condition {\textbar}λ{\textbar}=Re(λ)2+Im(λ)2≤1, revealed resonance couplings. The block-diagonal polyad structure of studied states was reconstructed and the polyad quantum number P=(8,3,2) form determined as being good for all studied states, up to nearly 14,000 cm−1.

In particular, two-dimensional hole systems show a highly anisotropic Zeeman spin splitting. We have investigated this anisotropy in GaAs/AlAs quantum well structures both experimentally and theoretically. By performing time-resolved Kerr rotation measurements, we found a non-diagonal tensor \$g\$ that manifests itself in unusual precessional motion as well as distinct dependencies of hole spin dynamics on the direction of the magnetic field \${\textbackslash}vec\{B\}\$. We quantify the individual components of the tensor \$g\$ for [113]-, [111]- and [110]-grown samples. We complement the experiments by a comprehensive theoretical study of Zeeman splitting in in-plane and out-of-plane fields \${\textbackslash}vec\{B\}\$. To this end, we develop a detailed multiband theory for the tensor \$g\$. Using perturbation theory, we derive transparent analytical expressions for the components of the tensor \$g\$ that we complement with accurate numerical calculations based on our theoretical framework. We obtain very good agreement between experiment and theory. Our study demonstrates that the tensor \$g\$ is neither symmetric nor antisymmetric. Opposite off-diagonal components can differ in size by up to an order of magnitude.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the spin dynamics and spin–orbit interaction in GaAs-based two-dimensional hole systems (2DHS) have created a lot of attention. This is due to the complex structure of the valence band, with its p-like character, which leads to strong spin–orbit coupling. In this paper, we review our recent studies on hole spin dynamics and valence-band spin excitations in GaAs-based, p-modulation-doped quantum wells (QWs). In 2DHS with low carrier concentration, we demonstrate that maximizing the heavy-hole–light-hole band splitting by changing the QW width leads to long hole spin dephasing times at low temperatures. Different mechanisms for initializing a resident hole spin polarization by optical excitation are presented. To accurately determine hole spin dynamics parameters, the resonant spin amplification technique is utilized. The strong anisotropy of the hole g factor, and electrical g factor control are investigated, using this technique. In highly doped 2DHS, we use resonant inelastic light scattering (RILS) to study the spin splitting of the valence band. We observe a low-energy spin-density excitation (SDE), which is a measure of the spin splitting of the hole ground state. By varying the laser energy in the RILS experiment, we can resonantly probe the k dependence of the spin splitting. The spectral shape of the SDE depends on the orientation of the light polarizations relative to the crystal axes and reflects the in-plane anisotropy of the valence-band spin splitting.},

Detailed structural information was gained by single-crystal XRD analyses of nine representative examples. The common structural motive is the central double ylidic carbon atom with its characteristic two lone pairs involved in the binding of two geminal L-Cu(I) fragments at Cu–Cu distances in the range 2.55–2.67 Å. In order to enhance conformational rigidity within the characteristic Cu–C–Cu triangle, two types of chelating side arms were symmetrically attached to each phosphorus atom: two 2-pyridyl functions in ligand CDP(Py)2 (1) and its dinuclear copper complexes 2–9 and 11, as well as two diphenylphosphinomethylene functions in ligand CDP(CH2PPh2)2 (13) and its di- and mononuclear complexes 14–18. Neutral complexes were typically obtained via the reaction of 1 with Cu(I) species CuCl, CuI, and CuSPh or via the salt elimination reaction of [(CuCl)2(CDP(Py)2] (2) with sodium carbazolate. Cationic Cu(I) complexes were prepared upon treating 1 with two equivalents of [Cu(NCMe)4]PF6, followed by the addition of either two equivalents of an aryl phosphine (PPh3, P(C6H4OMe)3) or one equivalent of bisphosphine ligands bis[(2-diphenylphosphino)phenyl] ether (DPEPhos), 4,5-bis(diphenylphosphino)-9,9-dimethylxanthene (XantPhos), or 1,1′-bis(diphenyl-phosphino) ferrocene (dppf). For the first time, carbodiphosphorane CDP(CH2PPh2)2 (13) could be isolated upon treating its precursor [CH(dppm)2]Cl (12) with NaNH2 in liquid NH3. A protonated and a deprotonated derivative of ligand 13 were prepared, and their coordination was compared to neutral CDP ligand 13. NMR analysis and DFT calculations reveal that the most stable tautomer of 13 does not show a CDP (or carbone) structure in its uncoordinated base form. For most of the prepared complexes, photoluminescence upon irradiation with UV light at room temperature was observed. Quantum yields (FPL) were determined to be 36\% for dicationic [(CuPPh3)2(CDP(Py)2)](PF6)2 (4) and 60\% for neutral [(CuSPh)2(CDP(CH2PPh2)2] (16).},

The D4 empirical dispersion correction has been added throughout. For subsets dominated by dynamical correlation, HF-DFT is highly beneficial, particularly at low HF exchange percentages. This is especially true for noncovalent interactions where the electrostatic component is dominant, such as hydrogen and halogen bonds: for π-stacking, HF-DFT is detrimental. For subsets with significant nondynamical correlation (i.e., where a Hartree−Fock determinant is not a good zero-order wavefunction), HF-DFT may do more harm than good. While the self-consistent series show optima at or near 37.5\% (i.e., 3/8) for all four XC functionalsconsistent with Grimme's proposal of the PBE38 functionalHF-BnLYP-D4, HF-PBEn-D4, and HF-TPSSn-D4 all exhibit minima nearer 25\% (i.e., 1/4) as the use of HF orbitals greatly mitigates the error at 25\% for barrier heights. Intriguingly, for HF-SCANn-D4, the minimum is near 10\%, but the weighted mean absolute error (WTMAD2) for GMTKN55 is only barely lower than that for HF-SCAN-D4 (i.e., where the post-HF step is a pure meta-GGA). The latter becomes an attractive option, only slightly more costly than pure Hartree−Fock, and devoid of adjustable parameters other than the three in the dispersion correction. Moreover, its WTMAD2 is only surpassed by the highly empirical M06-2X and by the combinatorially optimized empirical range-separated hybrids ωB97X-V and ωB97M-V.},

The addition to the final energy of both a D4 empirical dispersion correction, and of a semilocal correlation component lead, to significant improvements, with DSD-PBEdRPA75-D4 approaching the performance of revDSD-PBEP86-D4 and the Berkeley \${\textbackslash}omega\$B97M(2). This form appears to be fairly insensitive to the choice of semilocal functional, but does exhibit stronger basis set sensitivity than the PT2-based double hybrids (due to much larger prefactors for the nonlocal correlation). As an alternative, we explored adding an MP3-like correction term (in a medium-sized basis sets) to a range-separated \${\textbackslash}omega\$DSD-PBEP86-D4 double hybrid, and found it to have significantly lower WTMAD2 (weighted mean absolute deviation) for the large and chemically diverse GMTKN55 benchmark suite; the added computational cost can be mitigated through density fitting techniques.},

The existing conjugate gradient algorithms on a manifold endowed with a vector transport need the assumption that the vector transport does not increase the norm of tangent vectors, in order to confirm that generated sequences have a global convergence property. In this article, the notion of a scaled vector transport is introduced to improve the algorithm so that the generated sequences may have a global convergence property under a relaxed assumption. In the proposed algorithm, the transported vector is rescaled in case its norm has increased during the transport. The global convergence is theoretically proved and numerically observed with examples. In fact, numerical experiments show that there exist minimization problems for which the existing algorithm generates divergent sequences, but the proposed algorithm generates convergent sequences.},

Numerical results are obtained for the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator, the hydrogen atom and the one dimensional double-well anharmonic oscillator.},

	abstract = {The connection between closed Newton–Cotes differential methods and symplectic integrators is considered in this paper. Several one step symplectic integrators have been developed based on symplectic geometry. However, multistep symplectic integrators have seldom been investigated. Zhu et al. (J. Chem. Phys. 104 (1996) 2275) converted open Newton–Cotes differential methods into a multilayer symplectic structure. Also, Chiou and Wu (J. Chem. Phys. 107 (1997) 6894) have written on the construction of multistep symplectic integrators based on the open Newton–Cotes integration methods. In this work we examine the closed Newton–Cotes formulae and we write them as symplectic multilayer structures. We apply the symplectic schemes in order to solve Hamilton's equations of motion which are linear in position and momentum. We observe that the Hamiltonian energy of the system remains almost constant as integration proceeds.},

	abstract = {This article review the theory of local contrast in field-ion images, as it has developed over the last 15-20 years. The issue has been: how do we see atoms? The question has partly been whether contrast formation is dominated by a rate-constant or by a gas-concentration mechanism. But there has also been difficulty in establishing any satisfactory numerical explanation of the long-known resolving power of the field-ion microscope. Views on these issues have fluctuated, as understanding of the complicated physical situation has changed and as better models of various parts of the problem have been built. Recent work, involving new analyses of charged-surface models and JWKB-type rate-constant formulae, has much clarified the solution. It now seems probable that local contrast at normal operating temperatures (near 20K or above) is rate-constant determined, whereas local contrast at temperatures near 5K is dominated by imaging-gas distribution effects. Across-surface variations in the mean electric field in the forbidden ionization zone are very much greater than previously realised: the electron from the field-ionised atom has to tunnel through this zone, and these field variations lead to much greater rate-constant variations than previously estimated. Although much numerical modelling remains to be done, it is now possible to give a coherent, quantitatively justifiable, physical explanation of how the field-ion microscope works: we now know how men first saw atoms.},

	volume = {31},
	doi = {10.1021/acs.chemmater.9b00671},
	abstract = {Inspired by molecular crystal theory of coupling symmetry-related transition dipole moments, we develop a model for rational design of Cu(I) complexes to achieve short TADF (thermally activated delayed fluorescence) decay times. This is, for example, important to reduce OLED stability problems and roll-off effects. Guided by the model, we design a new class of Cu(I) dimers focusing on Cu2(tppb)(PPh3)2Cl2 2 (tppb(PPh3)2 = 1,2,4,5-tetrakis(diphenylphosphino)benzene). Indeed, this class of compounds shows particularly short TADF decay times as evidenced by luminescence studies over a temperature range of 1.5 K ≤ T ≤ 300 K and thus, supports the proposed design strategy. The model is further supported by TD-DFT calculations. A key property of the strategy is that the new dimer(s) exhibit a drastically faster radiative rate of the transition between the lowest excited singlet state and the ground state than the related monomer, Cu(dppb)(PPh3)Cl 1 (dppb = 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)benzene). This is even valid at a small singlet-triplet energy gap of △E(S1-T1) = 390 cm-1 (48 meV). Accordingly, we find a benchmark TADF decay time for the Cu(I) dimer 2 of only 1.2 μs (radiative decay: 1.5 μs). This a factor of about three times shorter than found so far for any other Cu(I) complex with similarly small energy gap. The presented design strategy seems to be of general validity.},

However, the minimal and characteristic polynomials of that transformation must coincide (but the initial sequence of vectors need not converge) for a numerically stable convergence of Aitken's acceleration to occur. Similar results hold for Steffensen's acceleration of the iterations of a function of several variables. First, the iterated function need not be a contracting map in any neighbourhood of its fixed point. Instead, the second partial derivatives need only remain bounded in such a neighbourhood for Steffensen's acceleration to converge quadratically, even if ordinary iterations diverge. Second, at the fixed point the minimal and characteristic polynomials of the Jacobian matrix must coincide to ensure a numerically stable convergence. By generalizing the work that Noda did on the subject between 1981 and 1986, the results presented here explain the numerical observations reported by Henrici in 1964 and 1982.},

	abstract = {Herein, we present a new strategy in which highly emissive thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials can be obtained from modifying or tuning a non-TADF donor (D)–acceptor (A)-type organic molecule via coordination of the metal ionic fragment. Theoretical calculation and photophysical properties reveal that the D–A-type free ligand emits both weak fluorescence and dual room-temperature phosphorescence, whereas the two Ag(I) complexes display efficient blue TADF, exhibiting photoluminescence quantum yields nearly 100\% in films with short decay lifetimes (τ ≈ 6 μs). This is attributed to the four optimized parameters induced by Ag(I) coordination: (1) narrow singlet (S1)–triplet (T1) energy gaps (ΔEST).

Theoretical calculation and photophysical properties reveal that the D-A-type free ligand emits both weak fluorescence and dual roomerature phosphorescence, whereas the two Ag(I) complexes display efficient blue TADF, exhibiting photoluminescence quantum yields nearly 100\% in films with short decay lifetimes (τ ≈ 6 μs). This is attributed to the four optimized parameters induced by Ag(I) coordination: (1) narrow singlet (S1)-triplet (T1) energy gaps (Î"EST). (2) T1 states have a hybrid local excitation and charge transfer (CT) character, and S1 states have a predominant CT character. Both the parameters facilitate reverse intersystem crossing.

This paper extends the application of the S.O.R. method to solve one of the nonlinear partial differential equation, which is the two-dimensional porous medium equation. The S.O.R. method is incorporated into an iterative method that is formulated based on a half-sweep finite difference approximation, and the Newton-type linearization solves the nonlinear term that presents in the equation.

Therefore, we suggest a multilevel algorithm that effectively finds a near-optimal shape parameter, which helps to significantly reduce the error.

Much of the research conducted so far has focused on electron mobility, which is determined by scattering from charged impurities and other inhomogeneities. However, another important quantity, the quantum capacitance, has been largely overlooked. Here, we report a direct measurement of the quantum capacitance of graphene as a function of gate potential using a three-electrode electrochemical configuration. The quantum capacitance has a non-zero minimum at the Dirac point and a linear increase on both sides of the minimum with relatively small slopes. Our findings -- which are not predicted by theory for ideal graphene -- suggest that charged impurities also influences the quantum capacitance. We also measured the capacitance in aqueous solutions at different ionic concentrations, and our results strongly indicate that the long-standing puzzle about the interfacial capacitance in carbon-based electrodes has a quantum origin.},

	abstract = {Recently, a modification of the Newton method for finding a zero of a univariate function with local cubic convergence has been introduced. Here, we extend this modification to the multi-dimensional case, i.e., we introduce a modified Newton method for vector functions that converges locally cubically, without the need to compute higher derivatives. The case of multiple roots is not treated. Per iteration the method requires one evaluation of the function vector and solving two linear systems with the Jacobian as coefficient matrix, where the Jacobian has to be evaluated twice. Since the additional computational effort is nearly that of an additional Newton step, the proposed method is useful especially in difficult cases where the number of iterations can be reduced by a factor of two in comparison to the Newton method. This much better convergence is indeed possible as shown by a numerical example. Also, the modified Newton method can be advantageous in cases where the evaluation of the function is more expensive than solving a linear system with the Jacobian as coefficient matrix. An example for this is given where numerical quadrature is involved. Finally, we discuss shortly possible extensions of the method to make it globally convergent. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

	url = {https://pred.uni-regensburg.de/id/eprint/42179/},
	abstract = {Sequence transformations are important tools for the convergence acceleration of slowly convergent scalar sequences or series and for the summation of divergent series. The basic idea is to construct from a given sequence \{\{s(n)\}\} a new sequence \{\{s(n)'\}\} = T(\{\{s(n)\}\}) where each s(n)' depends on a finite number of elements s(n1), ..., s(nm). Often, the s(n) are the partial sums of an infinite series. The aim is to find transformations such that \{\{s(n)'\}\} converges faster than (or sums) \{\{s(n)\}\}. Transformations T\{\{s(n)\}\}, \{\{w(n)\}\}) that depend not only on the sequence elements or partial sums s(n) but also on an auxiliary sequence of the so-called remainder estimates w(n) are of Levin-type if they are linear in the s(n), and nonlinear in the w(n). Such remainder estimates provide an easy-to-use possibility to use asymptotic information on the problem sequence for the construction of highly efficient sequence transformations. As shown first by Levin, it is possible to obtain such asymptotic information easily for large classes of sequences in such a way that the w(n) are simple functions of a few sequence elements s(n). Then, nonlinear sequence transformations are obtained. Special cases of such Levin-type transformations belong to the most powerful currently known extrapolation methods for scalar sequences and series. Here, we review known Levin-type sequence transformations and put them in a common theoretical framework. It is discussed how such transformations may be constructed by either a model sequence approach or by iteration of simple transformations. As illustration, two new sequence transformations are derived. Common properties and results on convergence acceleration and stability are given. For important special cases, extensions of the general results are presented. Also, guidelines for the application of Levin-type sequence transformations are discussed, and a few numerical examples are given. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The approximations retain their validity even on the cuts of the complex Riemann surface which allows for example the calculation of resonances in quantum mechanical problems.

Indeed, this class of compounds shows particularly short TADF decay times as evidenced by luminescence studies over a temperature range of 1.5 K {\textbackslash}ensuremath{\textless}= T {\textbackslash}ensuremath{\textless}= 300 K and, thus, supports the proposed design strategy. The model is further supported by TD-DFT calculations. A key property of the strategy is that the new dimer(s) exhibit a drastically faster radiative rate of the transition between the lowest excited singlet state and the ground state than the related monomer, Cu(dppb)(PPh3)Cl 1 (dppb = 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)benzene). This is even valid at a small singlet-triplet energy gap of Delta E(S-1-T-1) = 390 cm(-1) (48 meV). Accordingly, we find a benchmark TADF decay time for the Cu(I) dimer 2 of only 1.2 mu s (radiative decay: 1.5 mu s). This is a factor of about three times shorter than found so far for any other Cu(I) complex with a similarly small energy gap. The presented design strategy seems to be of general validity.},

However, the unique band structure and unusual exciton dynamics of SWCNTs add more possibilities to the classical PCT mechanism.In this work, we demonstrate PCT from photoexcited semiconducting (6,5) SWCNTs to a wide-bandgap wrapping poly-[(9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)-alt-(6,6')-(2,2'-bipyridine)] (PFO-BPy) via femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. By monitoring the spectral dynamics of the SWCNT polaron, we show that charge transfer from photoexcited SWCNTs to PFO-BPy can be driven not only by the energetically favorable E33 transition but also by the energetically unfavorable E22 excitation under high pump fluence. This unusual PCT from narrow-bandgap SWCNTs toward a wide-bandgap polymer originates from the up-converted high-energy excitonic state (E33 or higher) that is promoted by the Auger recombination of excitons and charge carriers in SWCNTs. These insights provide new pathways for charge separation in SWCNT-based photodetectors and photovoltaic cells.},

	abstract = {Excited state dynamics and energy levels of semiconducting single walled carbon nanotubes (CNT) wrapped with conjugated polymers are commonly discussed as if the polymer chains were absent. Similarly, when employed in charge carrying devices, e.g. field effect transistors, the polymer is at maximum considered as a potential barrier for inter-tube charge carrier hopping. Here, we employ photoluminescence- and pump-probe spectroscopy on films of semiconducting CNTs of different chirality wrapped with either a wide band gap polyfuorene derivative (PF12) or a polythiophene with narrower gap (P3DDT) to elucidate the excited states' interplay between the two materials in thin films. Excitation above the polymer band gap gives way to an ultrafast electron transfer from both polymers towards the CNTs. By monitoring the hole polaron on the polymer via its mid infrared signature, we show that also illumination below the polymer band gap leads to the formation of this fingerprint, and infer that holes are also transferred towards the polymer. As this contradicts the standard way of discussing the involved energy levels, we propose that polymer wrapped CNTs should be considered as a single hybrid system, exhibiting states shared between the two components. This proposition is validated through quantum chemical calculations that show hybridization of the first excited states, especially for the thiohpene-CNT sample.},

	abstract = {Printed random networks of polymer‐wrapped multi‐chiral semiconducting carbon nanotubes (s‐SWCNTs) are an opportunity for mass‐manufacturable, high‐performance large‐area electronics. To meet this goal, a deeper understanding of charge‐transport mechanisms in such mixed networks is crucial. Here, charge transport in field‐effect transistors based on inkjet‐printed s‐SWCNTs networks is investigated, obtaining direct evidence for the phases probed by charge in the accumulated channel, which is critical information to rationalize the different transport properties obtained for different printing conditions. In particular, when the fraction of nanotubes with smaller bandgaps is efficiently interconnected, the sparse network provides efficient charge percolation for band‐like transport, with a charge mobility as high as 20.2 cm² V⁻¹ s⁻¹. However, when the charges are forced by a less efficient morphology, to populate also higher bandgap nanotubes and and/or the wrapping polymer, thermally activated transport takes place and mobility drops. As a result, a trade‐off between network density and charge transport properties is identified for device current optimization, in both p‐ and n‐type regimes. These findings shed light on the fundamental aspects related to charge transport in printed s‐SWCNT mixed networks and contribute to devise appropriate strategies for the formulation of inks and processes towards cost‐effective mass production schemes of high‐performance large‐area electronics.},

This method can economically yield customized flexible SWCNT arrays with praiseworthy performance, such as high reproducibility, precision, uniformity, conductivity, and mechanical stability. In addition, the flexible SWCNT arrays can be easily functionalized into high-performance electrochemical sensors for the simultaneous monitoring of sweat metabolites (glucose, lactate) and electrolytes (Na+, K+). The integration of wearable sensing arrays with a signal acquisition and processing circuit system in the intelligent wearable sensors empowers them to realize noninvasive, real-time, and in situ sweat analysis during exercise. More meaningfully, such a PS-VFTP strategy can be easily expanded to the economical manufacturing of other flexible electronic devices.},

	abstract = {This review article focuses on the understanding of intersystem crossing (ISC) in molecules. It addresses readers who are interested in the phenomenon of intercombination transitions between states of different electron spin multiplicities but are not familiar with relativistic quantum chemistry. Among the spin-dependent interaction terms that enable a crossover between states of different electron spin multiplicities, spin–orbit coupling (SOC) is by far the most important. If SOC is small or vanishes by symmetry, ISC can proceed by electronic spin–spin coupling (SSC) or hyperfine interaction (HFI). Although this review discusses SSC- and HFI-based ISC, the emphasis is on SOC-based ISC. In addition to laying the theoretical foundations for the understanding of ISC, the review elaborates on the qualitative rules for estimating transition probabilities. Research on the mechanisms of ISC has experienced a major revival in recent years owing to its importance in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). Exemplified by challenging case studies, chemical substitution and solvent environment effects are discussed with the aim of helping the reader to understand and thereby get a handle on the factors that steer the efficiency of ISC.},

Some aspects of employing different electronic structure methods to obtain information about potential energy surfaces and interstate couplings for NAMD simulations are also discussed.

The analytic representations of three-center nuclear attraction integrals and multicenter bielectronic integrals over B functions involve semiinfinite highly oscillatory integrals, which can be transformed into infinite series. These integrals must be evaluated precisely and quickly. This work describes an efficient method for the evaluation of these integrals based on the nonlinear SD transformation, recently developed by Safouhi. The SD method was applied to multicenter integrals over B functions, and it is shown that this method is highly efficient compared with alternatives previously used. The SD approach should lead to a definitive suite of ab initio Slater software. The convergence properties were analyzed and they showed that the approximations obtained using the SD approach converge to the exact values of the semiinfinite integrals without any constraint. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We used 9,10-bis-(2,2-diphenylvinyl)-anthracene single crystals to produce blue and green light from identical single-crystal transistors. We also observed red light, which corresponds to the emission from in-gap states that are caused by impurities. Importantly, each of these different colors corresponds to a distinguishable light polarization, which enables us to tune the emission color by using a light polarizer.},

These are then evaluated using Fourier transforms. The resulting expression depends on the overlap integrals that can be evaluated with the greatest ease. They involve expressions for STO with different screening parameters that are known analytically.

Our approach is based on vector valued rational approximation where the approximants are determined by the denominator polynomials whose coefficients are obtained by solving an inexpensive linear least-squares problem. No matrix multiplications or divisions but matrix-vector products are required in the whole process. A technique of scaling and recurrence enables our method to be more effective when the problem is for fixed A , b and many values of t . We also give a backward error analysis in exact arithmetic for the truncation errors to derive our new algorithm. Preliminary numerical results illustrate that the new algorithm performs well.},

As a further possibility to test the performance of the method, vibrational frequencies and other spectroscopic constants of diatomic molecules are calculated by fitting different analytic functions to the hypersurfaces obtained by different methods and compared to experimental data.[1] H.

	abstract = {In this study, detailed spectroscopic investigations of the blue emitting compounds Ir(4,6-dFppy)2(pic) and Pt(4,6- dFppy)(acac) are presented. Due to spin-orbit coupling (SOC) of the emitting triplet state with higher lying singlet states both complexes show an intense phosphorescence and are utilized as emitters in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). Distinct differences with respect to important photophysical properties are found for the two compounds. For example, the (distorted) octahedral Ir(4,6-dFppy)2(pic) complex exhibits a shorter emission decay time and shows a larger zero-field splitting (ZFS) than the (distorted) square planar Pt(4,6-dFppy)(acac) complex (t(Ir)=0.4 ?s and t(Pt)=3.6 ?s of the respective shortest-lifed triplet substate; ?(ZFS, Ir)=67 cm-1, ?E(ZFS, Pt)=8 cm-1). This behaviour is connected with the extent of metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT, dp*) character in the emitting triplet state. High MLCT character usually results in a high emission decay rate and indicates a good suitability as OLED emitter material. Of crucial importance in this respect is the effectiveness of SOC. In this study it is shown that the SOC routes depend on the coordination geometry of the emitter compound. In particular, the couplings can be more effective in (distorted) octahedral than in (distorted) square planar compounds. Hence, the photophysical differences of Ir(4,6-dFppy)2(pic) compared to Pt(4,6-dFppy)(acac) can be rationalized. Moreover, this investigation shows that the analysis of SOC paths provides general guidelines for the design of efficient emitters for OLED applications.},

	abstract = {The integral bottleneck in evaluating molecular energies arises from the two-electron contributions. These are difficult and time-consuming to evaluate, especially over exponential type orbitals, used here to ensure the correct behavior of atomic orbitals. The two-center two-electron integrals are essential to describe atom pairs in molecules and distinguish those that are bound. In this work on analytical integration, it is shown that the two-center Coulomb integrals involved can be expressed as one-electron kinetic energy-like integrals. This is accomplished using the fact that the Coulomb operator is a Green's function of the Laplacian. The ensuing integrals may be further simplified by defining spectral forms for the one-electron potential satisfying Poisson's equation therein. A sum of overlap integrals with the atomic orbital energy eigenvalue as a factor is then obtained to give the Coulomb energy. This is most easily evaluated by direct integration. The orbitals involved in three and four center integrals are translated to two centers. This is discussed very briefly. The evaluation of exchange energy is a straightforward extension of this work. The summation coefficients in spectral forms are evaluated analytically from Gaunt coefficients. The Poisson method may be used to calculate Coulomb energy integrals efficiently. For a single processor, gains of CPU time for a given chemical accuracy exceed a factor of 4. This method lends itself to efficient evaluation on a parallel computer. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The norm of these matrices grows at the optimal rate O(N**2) for N-by-N matrices, in contrast to standard pseudospectral constructions that result in O(N**4) growth of the norm. The smaller norm has a big advantage when using the derivative matrix for solving time dependent problems such as wave propagation. The construction is based on representing the derivative operator as an integral kernel, and does not rely on the interpolating polynomials. In particular, we construct second derivative matrices that incorporate Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions on an interval and on the disk, but the method can be used to construct a wide variety of commonly used operators for solving \{PDEs\} and integral equations. The construction can be used with any quadrature, including traditional Gauss�Legendre quadratures, but we have found that by using quadratures based on prolate spheroidal wave functions, we can achieve a near optimal sampling rate close to two points per wavelength, even for non-periodic problems. We provide numerical results for the new construction and demonstrate that the construction achieves similar or better accuracy than traditional pseudospectral derivative matrices, while resulting in a norm that is orders of magnitude smaller than the standard construction. To demonstrate the advantage of the new construction, we apply the method for solving the wave equation in constant and discontinuous media and for solving \{PDEs\} on the unit disk. We also present two compression algorithms for applying the derivative matrices in O(N\&\#xa0;log\&\#xa0;N) operations.},

We compare the Lanczos algorithm in the 1987 implementation by Cullum and Willoughby with the shift-and-invert techniques in the implicitly restarted Lanczos method and in the Jacobi-Davidson method. Our preconditioning approaches for the shift-and-invert symmetric indefinite linear system are based on maximum weighted matchings and algebraic multilevel incomplete $^{\textrm{T\$}}$\$ factorizations. These techniques can be seen as a complement to the alternative idea of using more complete pivoting techniques for the highly ill-conditioned symmetric indefinite Anderson matrices. We demonstrate the effectiveness and the numerical accuracy of these algorithms. Our numerical examples reveal that recent algebraic multilevel preconditioning solvers can accelerate the computation of a large-scale eigenvalue problem corresponding to the Anderson model of localization by several orders of magnitude.},

The analytic representations of three-center nuclear attraction integrals and multicenter bielectronic integrals over B functions involve semiinfinite highly oscillatory integrals, which can be transformed into infinite series. These integrals must be evaluated precisely and quickly. This work describes an efficient method for the evaluation of these integrals based on the nonlinear SD transformation, recently developed by Safouhi. The SD method was applied to multicenter integrals over B functions, and it is shown that this method is highly efficient compared with alternatives previously used. The SD approach should lead to a definitive suite of ab initio Slater software. The convergence properties were analyzed and they showed that the approximations obtained using the SD approach converge to the exact values of the semiinfinite integrals without any constraint. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {In dieser Arbeit werden analytische Darstellungen und numerische Verfahren zur Berechnung der im Rahmen von nicht-relativistischen LCAO-MO-SCF-Rechnungen auftretenden Molekülintegrale für eine spezielle Klasse exponentialartiger Funktionen untersucht. Bei den Funktionen handelt es sich um die sogenannten B-Funktionen, die durch eine besonders einfache Fourier-Transformierte und eine sehr einfache Laplace-Darstellung ausgezeichnet sind. Damit sind B-Funktionen unter den exponentialartigen Funktionen prädestiniert für die Anwendung der Fourier-Transformationsmethode. Der skalare Anteil der B-Funktionen ist im wesentlichen durch eine reduzierte Bessel-Funktion gegeben. Bei diesen Untersuchungen werden Integraltransformationsmethoden zugrundegelegt. Dazu gehören die bereits genannte Fourier-Transformationsmethode und die Bessel-Transformationsmethode, die auf einer neuentdeckten, eindimensionalen Integraldarstellung für das Produkt zweier beliebiger reduzierter Bessel-Funktionen beruht, aus der eindimensionale Integraldarstellungen für zweizentrige Dichten zweier B-Funktionen hergeleitet werden. Diese zweizentrigen Dichten und ihre Fourier-Transformierten kann man aber als wesentlichen Baustein von mehrzentrigen Molekülintegralen mit B-Funktionen auffassen. Die Verwendung dieser Transformationsmethoden erlaubt folgerichtig die Herleitung einer Reihe von neuen Darstellungen für Molekülintegrale mit B-Funktionen. Numerisch werden vor allem Integraldarstellungen für Molekülintegrale mit B-Funktionen untersucht, die man mit der Fourier-Transformationsmethode herleiten kann. Für die numerische Auswertung dieser Integraldarstellungen werden neue Quadraturverfahren eingeführt. Besondere Berücksichtigung dabei findet der Fall stark unterschiedlicher Exponentialparameter, für den herkömmliche Methoden Schwierigkeiten haben. Durch eingehende Analyse wird als Grund dieser Schwierigkeiten das Auftreten von bestimmten Gewichtsfunktionen festgestellt. Diese Gewichtsfunktionen verursachen scharfe Spitzen, die die numerische Quadratur stark erschweren. Dieses Problem wird gelöst mit Hilfe von speziellen Koordinatentransformationen, den Möbius-Transformationen, und den darauf aufbauenden, neuen Quadraturverfahren. - Abschnitt 1: Einleitung (Quantenchemische Näherungsverfahren, Übersicht über die Arbeit und Abgrenzung des Themas) Abschnitt 2: Zusammenstellung wichtiger Definitionen und Bezeichnungen Abschnitt 3: Allgemeine Eigenschaften von B-Funktionen und Produkten von B-Funktionen Abschnitt 4: Integraltransformationsmethoden zur Behandlung von Molekülintegralen mit B-Funktionen Abschnitt 5: Numerische Quadraturverfahren bei Molekülintegralen mit B-Funktionen Abschnitt 6: Ein-Elektron-Integrale bei B-Funktionen: Fourier-Transformierte von Produkten zweier B-Funktionen, Überlappungsintegrale und verwandte Integrale Abschnitt 7: Ein-Elektron-Integrale mit B-Funktionen: Kernanziehungsintegrale Abschnitt 8: Zwei-Elektronen-Integrale mit B-Funktionen Anhang A: Einige Details über reduzierte Bessel-Funktionen Anhang B: Einige Grö{\textbackslash}textbackslashs sen mit Bezug zur Kugeldrehgruppe Anhang C: Programmtechnische Details Anhang D: Zweizentrige Produkte zweier B-Funktionen: Rekursionen Anhang E: Umrechnung von Laguerre-Regeln Anhang F: Zur Implementierung der Regel W\$”\$ Anhang G: Eigenschaften der Sigma-Funktionen},

Moreover a quadratic nonlinear majorant for a nonlinear operator, according to the conditions laid upon it, is built. A priori and a posteriori estimations of the method�s error are received. The method needs almost the same number of computations as the classical Secant method, but has a higher order of convergence.

	abstract = {Organic light emitting diodes based on fluorophores with a propensity for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) are able to circumvent limitations imposed on device efficiency by spin statistics. Molecules with a propensity for TADF necessarily have two properties: a small gap between the lowest lying singlet and triplet excited states and a large transition dipole moment for fluorescence. In this work, we demonstrate the use of a genetic algorithm to search a region of chemical space for molecules with these properties. This algorithm is based on a flexible and intuitive representation of the molecule as a tree data structure, in which the nodes correspond to molecular fragments. Our implementation takes advantage of hybrid parallel graphics processing unit accelerated computer clusters to allow efficient sampling while retaining a reasonably accurate description of the electronic structure (in this case, CAM-B3LYP/6-31G**). In total, we have identified 3792 promising candidate fluorophores from a chemical space containing 1.26 � 10**6 molecules. This required performing electronic structure calculations on only 7518 molecules, a small fraction of the full space. Several novel classes of molecules which show promise as fluorophores are presented.},

The rational interpolants are of the continued fraction form, with scalar denominator. In this respect the approach is essentially different from that of Bose and Basu (1980) where a rational matrix-valued approximant with matrix-valued numerator and denominator is used for the approximation of a bivariate matrix power series. The matrix quotients are based on the generalized inverse for a matrix introduced by Gu Chuanqing and Chen Zhibing (1995) which is found to be effective in continued fraction interpolation. A sufficient condition of existence is obtained. Some important conclusions such as characterisation and uniqueness are proven respectfully. The inner connection between two type interpolating functions is investigated. Some examples are given so as to illustrate the results in the paper.},

Different from the previous work, in this paper we consider a new method of matrix rational interpolation, with rectangular real or complex interpolated matrices and distinct real or complex interpolation points. Based on an axiomatic definition for the generalized inverse matrix rational interpolants (GMRI), \{GMRI\} are constructed in the following two forms: (i) Thiele-type continued fraction expression; (ii) an explicit determinantal formula for the denominator scalar polynomials and for the numerator matrix polynomials, which are of Lagrange-type expression. As a direct application of GMRI, a matrix rational extrapolation is introduced.},

	abstract = {"Let F(z) be a vector-valued function, F: C - CN, which is analytic at z=0 and meromorphic in a neighbourhood of z=0, and let its Maclaurin series be given. In this work we develop vector-valued rational approximation procedures for F(z) by applying vector extrapolation methods to the sequence of partial sums of its Maclaurin series. We analyze some of the algebraic and analytic properties of the rational approximations thus obtained and show that they are akin to Pad� approximants. In particular, we prove a Koenig-type theorem concerning their poles and a de Montessus-type theorem concerning their uniform convergence. We show how "optimal" approximations to multiple poles and to Laurent expansions about these poles can be constructed. Extensions of the procedures above and the accompanying theoretical results to functions defined in arbitrary linear spaces is also considered. One of the most interesting and immediate applications of the results of this work is to the matrix eigenvalue problem. In a new work we exploit the developments of the present work to devise bona fide generalizations of the classical power method that are especially suitable for very large and sparse matrices. These generalizations can be used to approximate simultaneously several of the largest distinct eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors and invariant subspaces of arbitrary matrices, which may or may not be diagonalizable, and are very closely related with known Krylov subspace methods.

	abstract = {A divergent perturbation series is known to yield very unreliable results for observables even at moderate coupling strengths. One of the most popular techniques in handling such series is to express them as rational functions, but it is often faithful only for small coupling. We outline here how one can gain considerable advantages in the large-coupling regime by properly embedding known asymptotic scaling relations for selected observables during construction of the aforesaid Padé approximants. Three new bypass routes are explored in this context. The first approach involves a weighted geometric mean of two neighboring PA. The second idea is to consider series for specific ratios of observables. The third strategy is to express observables as functionals of the total energy in the form of series expansions. Symanzik's scaling relation, and the virial and Hellmann–Feynman theorems, are used at appropriate places to aid each of the strategies. Pilot calculations on the ground-state perturbation series of certain observables for the quartic anharmonic oscillator problem reveal readily the benefit and novelty. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Laplace transform is a powerful method for enabling solving differential equation in engineering and science. Using the Laplace transform for solving differential equations, however, sometimes leads to solutions in the Laplace domain that are not readily invertible to the real domain by analytical means. Numerical inversion methods are then used to convert the obtained solution from the Laplace domain into the real domain. Four inversion methods are evaluated in this paper. Several test functions, which arise in engineering applications, are used to evaluate the inversion methods. We also show that each of the inversion methods is accurate for a particular case. This study shows that among all these methods, the Fourier transform inversion technique is the most powerful but also the most computationally expensive. Stehfest’s method, which is used in many engineering applications is easy to implement and leads to accurate results for many problems including diffusion-dominated ones and solutions that behave like e−t type functions. However, this method fails to predict et type functions or those with an oscillatory response, such as sine and wave functions.},

	abstract = {In dieser Arbeit werden analytische Darstellungen und numerische Verfahren zur Berechnung der im Rahmen von nicht-relativistischen LCAO-MO-SCF-Rechnungen auftretenden Molekülintegrale für eine spezielle Klasse exponentialartiger Funktionen untersucht. Bei den Funktionen handelt es sich um die sogenannten B-Funktionen, die durch eine besonders einfache Fourier-Transformierte und eine sehr einfache Laplace-Darstellung ausgezeichnet sind. Damit sind B-Funktionen unter den exponentialartigen Funktionen prädestiniert für die Anwendung der Fourier-Transformationsmethode. Der skalare Anteil der B-Funktionen ist im wesentlichen durch eine reduzierte Bessel-Funktion gegeben. Bei diesen Untersuchungen werden Integraltransformationsmethoden zugrundegelegt. Dazu gehören die bereits genannte Fourier-Transformationsmethode und die Bessel-Transformationsmethode, die auf einer neuentdeckten, eindimensionalen Integraldarstellung für das Produkt zweier beliebiger reduzierter Bessel-Funktionen beruht, aus der eindimensionale Integraldarstellungen für zweizentrige Dichten zweier B-Funktionen hergeleitet werden. Diese zweizentrigen Dichten und ihre Fourier-Transformierten kann man aber als wesentlichen Baustein von mehrzentrigen Molekülintegralen mit B-Funktionen auffassen. Die Verwendung dieser Transformationsmethoden erlaubt folgerichtig die Herleitung einer Reihe von neuen Darstellungen für Molekülintegrale mit B-Funktionen. Numerisch werden vor allem Integraldarstellungen für Molekülintegrale mit B-Funktionen untersucht, die man mit der Fourier-Transformationsmethode herleiten kann. Für die numerische Auswertung dieser Integraldarstellungen werden neue Quadraturverfahren eingeführt. Besondere Berücksichtigung dabei findet der Fall stark unterschiedlicher Exponentialparameter, für den herkömmliche Methoden Schwierigkeiten haben. Durch eingehende Analyse wird als Grund dieser Schwierigkeiten das Auftreten von bestimmten Gewichtsfunktionen festgestellt. Diese Gewichtsfunktionen verursachen scharfe Spitzen, die die numerische Quadratur stark erschweren. Dieses Problem wird gelöst mit Hilfe von speziellen Koordinatentransformationen, den Möbius-Transformationen, und den darauf aufbauenden, neuen Quadraturverfahren. - Abschnitt 1: Einleitung (Quantenchemische Näherungsverfahren, Übersicht über die Arbeit und Abgrenzung des Themas) Abschnitt 2: Zusammenstellung wichtiger Definitionen und Bezeichnungen Abschnitt 3: Allgemeine Eigenschaften von B-Funktionen und Produkten von B-Funktionen Abschnitt 4: Integraltransformationsmethoden zur Behandlung von Molekülintegralen mit B-Funktionen Abschnitt 5: Numerische Quadraturverfahren bei Molekülintegralen mit B-Funktionen Abschnitt 6: Ein-Elektron-Integrale bei B-Funktionen: Fourier-Transformierte von Produkten zweier B-Funktionen, Überlappungsintegrale und verwandte Integrale Abschnitt 7: Ein-Elektron-Integrale mit B-Funktionen: Kernanziehungsintegrale Abschnitt 8: Zwei-Elektronen-Integrale mit B-Funktionen Anhang A: Einige Details über reduzierte Bessel-Funktionen Anhang B: Einige Grö{\textbackslash}textbackslashs sen mit Bezug zur Kugeldrehgruppe Anhang C: Programmtechnische Details Anhang D: Zweizentrige Produkte zweier B-Funktionen: Rekursionen Anhang E: Umrechnung von Laguerre-Regeln Anhang F: Zur Implementierung der Regel W\$”\$ Anhang G: Eigenschaften der Sigma-Funktionen},

	abstract = {In dieser Arbeit werden analytische Darstellungen und numerische Verfahren zur Berechnung der im Rahmen von nicht-relativistischen LCAO-MO-SCF-Rechnungen auftretenden Molekülintegrale für eine spezielle Klasse exponentialartiger Funktionen untersucht. Bei den Funktionen handelt es sich um die sogenannten B-Funktionen, die durch eine besonders einfache Fourier-Transformierte und eine sehr einfache Laplace-Darstellung ausgezeichnet sind. Damit sind B-Funktionen unter den exponentialartigen Funktionen prädestiniert für die Anwendung der Fourier-Transformationsmethode. Der skalare Anteil der B-Funktionen ist im wesentlichen durch eine reduzierte Bessel-Funktion gegeben. Bei diesen Untersuchungen werden Integraltransformationsmethoden zugrundegelegt. Dazu gehören die bereits genannte Fourier-Transformationsmethode und die Bessel-Transformationsmethode, die auf einer neuentdeckten, eindimensionalen Integraldarstellung für das Produkt zweier beliebiger reduzierter Bessel-Funktionen beruht, aus der eindimensionale Integraldarstellungen für zweizentrige Dichten zweier B-Funktionen hergeleitet werden. Diese zweizentrigen Dichten und ihre Fourier-Transformierten kann man aber als wesentlichen Baustein von mehrzentrigen Molekülintegralen mit B-Funktionen auffassen. Die Verwendung dieser Transformationsmethoden erlaubt folgerichtig die Herleitung einer Reihe von neuen Darstellungen für Molekülintegrale mit B-Funktionen. Numerisch werden vor allem Integraldarstellungen für Molekülintegrale mit B-Funktionen untersucht, die man mit der Fourier-Transformationsmethode herleiten kann. Für die numerische Auswertung dieser Integraldarstellungen werden neue Quadraturverfahren eingeführt. Besondere Berücksichtigung dabei findet der Fall stark unterschiedlicher Exponentialparameter, für den herkömmliche Methoden Schwierigkeiten haben. Durch eingehende Analyse wird als Grund dieser Schwierigkeiten das Auftreten von bestimmten Gewichtsfunktionen festgestellt. Diese Gewichtsfunktionen verursachen scharfe Spitzen, die die numerische Quadratur stark erschweren. Dieses Problem wird gelöst mit Hilfe von speziellen Koordinatentransformationen, den Möbius-Transformationen, und den darauf aufbauenden, neuen Quadraturverfahren. - Abschnitt 1: Einleitung (Quantenchemische Näherungsverfahren, Übersicht über die Arbeit und Abgrenzung des Themas) Abschnitt 2: Zusammenstellung wichtiger Definitionen und Bezeichnungen Abschnitt 3: Allgemeine Eigenschaften von B-Funktionen und Produkten von B-Funktionen Abschnitt 4: Integraltransformationsmethoden zur Behandlung von Molekülintegralen mit B-Funktionen Abschnitt 5: Numerische Quadraturverfahren bei Molekülintegralen mit B-Funktionen Abschnitt 6: Ein-Elektron-Integrale bei B-Funktionen: Fourier-Transformierte von Produkten zweier B-Funktionen, Überlappungsintegrale und verwandte Integrale Abschnitt 7: Ein-Elektron-Integrale mit B-Funktionen: Kernanziehungsintegrale Abschnitt 8: Zwei-Elektronen-Integrale mit B-Funktionen Anhang A: Einige Details über reduzierte Bessel-Funktionen Anhang B: Einige Grö{\textbackslash}textbackslashs sen mit Bezug zur Kugeldrehgruppe Anhang C: Programmtechnische Details Anhang D: Zweizentrige Produkte zweier B-Funktionen: Rekursionen Anhang E: Umrechnung von Laguerre-Regeln Anhang F: Zur Implementierung der Regel W\$”\$ Anhang G: Eigenschaften der Sigma-Funktionen},

	abstract = {Performing quantum chemical integral evaluation directly, without recursion and without direct coupling of angular momenta according to the rotation group is analyzed. The rotation group limits the structure of these closed-form expressions. The result of all cross differentiation is a rotational invariant. Closed-form expressions are obtained for the general three- and four-center Gaussian integral. The solid harmonic addition formula can be used to express these integrals as sums of products of an exponent-independent (angular) factor and a molecular-orientation-independent (exponential) factor in a variety of ways. The results are products of two such factors summed over the set of distinct, relevant polynomials of the exponents. The coefficients of these polynomials, angular factors, are complicated but common to all n-center matrix elements and independent of any type of contraction. Derivatives must be obtained using the product rule. An implementation in the Solid Spherical Harmonic Gaussian (SSHG) computer code is outlined and preliminary comparison is made. © 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc. Int J Quant Chem 81: 373–383, 2001},

In this work, the relative merits of various exponential-type orbitals (ETOs) are investigated for solving problems of interest to nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), while showing how they are related mathematically. The preferred ETOs will be shown to be the hydrogenic orbitals and similar Coulomb Sturmians. Slater-type functions (STFs) will be compared with them, and suitable equivalent (seldom used) combinations given. The correct shielding of the nucleus, resulting from radial factors of hydrogenic orbitals, is finally shown to be essential in the evaluation of precise nuclear shielding tensors for NMR spectroscopy of molecules using ab initio or DFT methods. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We used 9,10-bis-(2,2-diphenylvinyl)-anthracene single crystals to produce blue and green light from identical single-crystal transistors. We also observed red light, which corresponds to the emission from in-gap states that are caused by impurities. Importantly, each of these different colors corresponds to a distinguishable light polarization, which enables us to tune the emission color by using a light polarizer.},

Our approach is based on vector valued rational approximation where the approximants are determined by the denominator polynomials whose coefficients are obtained by solving an inexpensive linear least-squares problem. No matrix multiplications or divisions but matrix-vector products are required in the whole process. A technique of scaling and recurrence enables our method to be more effective when the problem is for fixed A , b and many values of t . We also give a backward error analysis in exact arithmetic for the truncation errors to derive our new algorithm. Preliminary numerical results illustrate that the new algorithm performs well.},

The key to the method is an efficient means for evaluating the zeros of a sequence of rational functions, having linear numerators, fitted to information previously computed. Regional and asymptotic convergence properties of the method are described. Conditions sufficient to ensure convergence are derived, and it is shown that asymptotically quadratic convergence can be achieved, at the cost of only a moderate amount of "overhead" computation.},

Two methods for implementing the LSC-IVR/classical Wigner which are in principle feasible to be combined with general force fields or even ab initio electronic structure methods have been reviewed. One is the local Gaussian approximation with the imaginary time path integral approach, the other is the quantum thermal bath method.

In this paper, we apply matrix Padé-type approximation instead of typical Padé approximation to computing the matrix exponential. In our approach the scaling and squaring method is also used to make the approximant more accurate. We present two algorithms for computing and for computing with many espectively. Numerical experiments comparing the proposed method with other existing methods which are MATLAB’s functions expm and funm show that our approach is also very effective and reliable for computing the matrix exponential . Moreover, there are two main advantages of our approach. One is that there is no inverse of a matrix required in this method. The other is that this method is more convenient when computing for a fixed matrix A with many t .ge. 0.},

Baba-Ahmed and J. Gayoso, Int. J. Quant. Chem. 23, 71 (1983), Eq. (51)] and which is easily programmed for a computer. The present investigation offers an advantage in that general formulas are derived which facilitate computation of the overlap and related two-center integrals over all Slater-type orbitals (STOs) with eventual nonintegral values of the principal quantum number. The proposed algorithm permits to avoid the procedure of interpolation [A. Baba-Ahmed and J. Gayoso, Theor. Chim.

For this end, ground state energies are calculated at the MP4 level for various basis sets of increasing size. With negligible extra effort, the Π2, F4, and [2/2] estimators are obtained, together with information on the reliability of the basic perturbation series [1]. The results are compared to more expensive CCSD(T) results. Also, electronic energy hypersurfaces are calculated at these levels. As a further possibility to test the performance of the method, vibrational frequencies and other spectroscopic constants of diatomic molecules are calculated by fitting different analytic functions to the hypersurfaces obtained by different methods and compared to experimental data.[1] H.

	abstract = {A principal tool for the construction of the addition theorem of a function f is the translation operator er′⋅∇, which generates f(r+r′) by doing a three-dimensional Taylor expansion of f around r. In atomic and molecular quantum mechanics, one is usually interested in irreducible spherical tensors. In such a case, the application of the translation operator in its Cartesian form ex′∂/∂xey′∂/∂yez′∂/∂z leads to serious technical problems. A much more promising approach consists of the use of an operator expansion for er′⋅∇ which contains exclusively irreducible spherical tensors. This expansion contains as differential operators the Laplacian ∇2 and the spherical tensor gradient operator 𝒴 lm(∇), which is an irreducible spherical tensor of rank l. Thus, if 𝒴 lm(∇) is applied to another spherical tensor, the angular part of the resulting expression is completely determined by angular momentum coupling, whereas the radial part is obtained by differentiating the radial part of the spherical tensor with respect to r. Consequently, the systematic use of the spherical tensor gradient operator leads to a considerable technical simplification. In this way, the originally three-dimensional expansion problem in x, y, and z is reduced to an essentially one-dimensional expansion problem in r. The practical usefulness of this approach is demonstrated by constructing the Laplace expansion of the Coulomb potential as well as the addition theorems of the regular and irregular solid harmonics and of the Yukawa potential. © 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

Because the molecular multicenter integrals of the much simpler Slater-type functions are notoriously difficult, it is not at all obvious why B functions should offer any advantages. However, B functions have Fourier transforms of exceptional simplicity, which greatly simplifies many of their molecular multicenter integrals. This article discusses the historical development of B functions from the perspective of the interaction between mathematics and theoretical chemistry, which traditionally has not been very good. Nevertheless, future progress in theoretical chemistry depends very much on a fertile interaction with neighboring disciplines. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Int J Quantum Chem, 2009},

	abstract = {We present programs for the calculation and evaluation of special type Hermite�Pad�-approximations. They allow the user to either numerically approximate multi-valued functions represented by a formal series expansion or to compute explicit approximants for them. The approximation scheme is based on Hermite�Pad� polynomials and includes both Pad� and algebraic approximants as limiting cases. The algorithm for the computation of the Hermite�Pad� polynomials is based on a set of recursive equations which were derived from a generalization of continued fractions. The approximations retain their validity even on the cuts of the complex Riemann surface which allows for example the calculation of resonances in quantum mechanical problems. The programs also allow for the construction of multi-series approximations which can be more powerful than most summation methods.

These functions can be numerically approximated by summation methods even if the corresponding series is only asymptotic. With the help of Hermite�Pad�-approximants many different approximation schemes can be realized. Pad� and algebraic approximants are just well-known examples. Hermite�Pad�-approximants combine the advantages of highly accurate numerical results with the additional advantage of being able to sum complex multi-valued functions. Method of solution: Special type Hermite�Pad� polynomials are calculated for a set of divergent series. These polynomials are then used to implicitly define approximants for one of the functions of this set. This approximant can be numerically evaluated at any point of the Riemann surface of this function. For an approximation order not greater than 3 the approximants can alternatively be expressed in closed form and then be used to approximate the desired function on its complete Riemann surface. Restriction on the complexity of the problem: In principle, the algorithm is only limited by the available memory and speed of the underlying computer system. Furthermore the achievable accuracy of the approximation only depends on the number of known series coefficients of the function to be approximated assuming of course that these coefficients are known with enough accuracy.

The application of the translation operator in its spherical form is particularly simple in the case of B functions and leads to an addition theorem with a comparatively compact structure. Since other exponentially decaying functions like Slater-type functions, bound-state hydrogenic eigenfunctions, and other functions based on generalized Laguerre polynomials can be expressed by simple finite sums of B functions, the addition theorems for these functions can be written down immediately. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {The interest in organic molecules exhibiting thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) has been reinvigorated in recent years owing to their potential to be exploited as emitters in highly efficient purely organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, designing new molecules that exhibit efficient TADF is a non-trivial task because they would appear to require the optimisation of a number of contrasting properties. For example these molecules must exhibit rapid conversion between the singlet and triplet manifolds without the use of heavy elements to enhance spin–orbit coupling. They should also display a large fluorescence rate, but simultaneously a small energy gap between low lying singlet and triplet states. Consequently to achieve systematic material design, a detailed understanding of the fundamental factors influencing the photophysical behaviour of TADF emitters is essential. Towards achieving this goal, theory and computation is playing a crucial role. In this feature article the recent progress in the theory of organic TADF molecules in the context of OLEDs is presented, with a view of achieving a deeper understanding of these molecules and driving systematic material design.},

We conclude from experiment that Power method is effective and more competitive for the well condition problem i.e. small value of α. However, for α → 1 Power method becomes more complex, and other methods such as Aitken-Power, SOR, and Gauss-Seidel are more efficient than it in respect of CPU time as well as the number of iteration needed for convergence.},

The components of the vector q = q(q1, q2,...qd) are parameters which define the molecular geometry, and d is the total number of internal degrees of freedom defining the nuclear configuration space. This pointwise representation of the surface is rarely of much use either in visualization of the surface or in calculations of the reaction dynamics. A continuous representation can be derived from the given points by fitting a function to them. While the form of the function is at the disposal of the researcher, the effort required to obtain a given accuracy of fit can depend strongly on the functional form chosen. Several classes of functions have been used in interpolations, e.g., cubic splines,1 polynomials,2 Padé approximants,3 and ad hoc functions suggested by the physics of the problem.4,5 None of these, except perhaps the last, are particularly suited to the representation of potential surfaces in that these surfaces are not of the same form as the fitting function. For example, polynomials are not bounded as their arguments go to plus or minus infinity, have a fixed number of extrema and inflection points, and cannot be multi-valued as can potential surfaces if more than one state of the molecule in question is considered.},

	abstract = {Cu(I) complexes often show transitions of distinct metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) character. This can lead to small energy separations between the lowest singlet S1 and triplet T1 state. Hence, thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and, if applied to electroluminescent devices, singlet harvesting can become highly effective. In this contribution, we introduce the TADF mechanism and identify crucial parameters that are necessary to optimize materials’ properties, in particular, with respect to short emission decay times and high quantum yields at ambient temperature. In different case studies, we present a photophysical background for a deeper understanding of the materials’ properties. Accordingly, we elucidate strategies for obtaining high quantum yields. These are mainly based on enhancing the intrinsic rigidity of the complexes and of their environment. Efficient TADF essentially requires small energy separations ΔE(S1–T1) with preference below about 1000cm−1 (≈120meV). This is achievable with complexes that exhibit small spatial HOMO–LUMO overlap. Thus, energy separations below 300cm−1 (≈37meV) are obtained, giving short radiative TADF decay times of less than 5μs. In a case study, it is shown that the TADF properties may be tuned or the TADF effect can even be turned off. However, very small ΔE(S1–T1) energy separations are related to small radiative rates or small oscillator strengths of the S1→S0 transitions due to the (required) small HOMO–LUMO overlap, as discussed in a further case study. Moreover, large spin–orbit coupling (SOC) of the triplet state to higher lying singlet states can induce an additional phosphorescence decay path that leads to a luminescence consisting of TADF and phosphorescence, thus leading to a combined singlet harvesting and triplet harvesting mechanism. This gives an overall reduction of the decay time. Finally, in a strongly simplified model, the SOC efficiency is traced back to easily obtainable results from DFT calculations.},

The photoluminescence quantum yield amounts to ΦPL = 80\% in toluene and 90\% in PMMA arising from prompt and delayed fluorescence with decay times of 21 ns and 30 μs, respectively. From an Arrhenius plot, the energy gap ΔE(S1 – T1) between the lowest excited singlet S1 and triplet T1 state was determined to be 980 cm–1 (120 meV).

	abstract = {We present programs for the calculation and evaluation of special type Hermite-Padé-approximations. They allow the user to either numerically approximate multi-valued functions represented by a formal series expansion or to compute explicit approximants for them. The approximation scheme is based on Hermite-Padé polynomials and includes both Padé and algebraic approximants as limiting cases. The algorithm for the computation of the Hermite-Padé polynomials is based on a set of recursive equations which were derived from a generalization of continued fractions. The approximations retain their validity even on the cuts of the complex Riemann surface which allows for example the calculation of resonances in quantum mechanical problems. The programs also allow for the construction of multi-series approximations which can be more powerful than most summation methods.

These functions can be numerically approximated by summation methods even if the corresponding series is only asymptotic. With the help of Hermite-Padé-approximants many different approximation schemes can be realized. Padé and algebraic approximants are just well-known examples. Hermite-Padé-approximants combine the advantages of highly accurate numerical results with the additional advantage of being able to sum complex multi-valued functions. Method of solution: Special type Hermite-Padé polynomials are calculated for a set of divergent series. These polynomials are then used to implicitly define approximants for one of the functions of this set. This approximant can be numerically evaluated at any point of the Riemann surface of this function. For an approximation order not greater than 3 the approximants can alternatively be expressed in closed form and then be used to approximate the desired function on its complete Riemann surface. Restriction on the complexity of the problem: In principle, the algorithm is only limited by the available memory and speed of the underlying computer system. Furthermore the achievable accuracy of the approximation only depends on the number of known series coefficients of the function to be approximated assuming of course that these coefficients are known with enough accuracy.

The compounds’ photophysical properties, being markedly different, are largely controlled by spin–orbit coupling (SOC). Therefore, we study the impact of SOC on the triplet state and elucidate the dominant SOC and state-mixing paths. These depend distinctly on the compounds’ coordination geometry. Relatively simple rules and relations are pointed out.

Their fluorescence emission is strongly enhanced and their colors are changed upon assembly, which can be ascribed to the supramolecular assembly-induced enhanced emission and Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) processes between H1-4C4P (or H2-2C4P) and DSA-G. Both ensembles of DSA-G⊂H1-4C4P and DSA-G⊂H2-2C4P exhibit thermo and solvent dual-responsive features, while DSA-G⊂H2-2C4P shows higher sensitivity toward external stimuli as compared to DSA G⊂H1-4C4P due to the shorter distance between fluorophores. The use of these fluorescent materials as inks confirms their efficiencies in the solid-state, paving the way for new potential applications of smart optical materials based on supramolecular assemblies.},

	abstract = {Confining carbon dots (CDs) in zeolites may boost the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emission. However, so far only blue-emissive CD-based TADF materials are reported, and rationally tuning the TADF emission of these materials remains challenging. Herein, by in situ embedding different emissive CDs into a zeolite matrix, we have successfully prepared a series of CD@zeolite composites with tunable TADF emission from blue to green by utilizing energy transfer (ET) between confined CDs. The as-prepared CD@zeolite composites exhibit lifetimes varying from 271 ms to 860 ms and quantum yields ranging from 20\% to 42\%. The ET process occurs from the singlet excited state of the blue emissive CD donor to the singlet excited state of green emissive CD acceptors with different polymerization degrees, promoting tunable TADF with cyan, mint green and olive green emission. The design concept proposed in this work may open a way to judicious tuning of the emission of TADF materials, and thus may broaden the applications of CD-based TADF materials.},

	abstract = {The integral bottleneck in evaluating molecular energies arises from the two-electron contributions. These are difficult and time-consuming to evaluate, especially over exponential type orbitals, used here to ensure the correct behavior of atomic orbitals. The two-center two-electron integrals are essential to describe atom pairs in molecules and distinguish those that are bound. In this work on analytical integration, it is shown that the two-center Coulomb integrals involved can be expressed as one-electron kinetic energy-like integrals. This is accomplished using the fact that the Coulomb operator is a Green's function of the Laplacian. The ensuing integrals may be further simplified by defining spectral forms for the one-electron potential satisfying Poisson's equation therein. A sum of overlap integrals with the atomic orbital energy eigenvalue as a factor is then obtained to give the Coulomb energy. This is most easily evaluated by direct integration. The orbitals involved in three and four center integrals are translated to two centers. This is discussed very briefly. The evaluation of exchange energy is a straightforward extension of this work. The summation coefficients in spectral forms are evaluated analytically from Gaunt coefficients. The Poisson method may be used to calculate Coulomb energy integrals efficiently. For a single processor, gains of CPU time for a given chemical accuracy exceed a factor of 4. This method lends itself to efficient evaluation on a parallel computer. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The methods are usually compared by evaluating the computational efficiency and the efficiency index. In this paper all the methods have the same efficiency, since they are of the same order and use the same information. Frequently, comparisons of the various schemes are based on the number of iterations required for convergence, number of function evaluations, and/or amount of \{CPU\} time. If a particular algorithm does not converge or if it converges to a different solution, then that particular algorithm is thought to be inferior to the others. The primary flaw in this type of comparison is that the starting point represents only one of an infinite number of other choices. Here we use the basin of attraction idea to recommend the best fourth order method. The basin of attraction is a method to visually comprehend how an algorithm behaves as a function of the various starting points.},

The modification is performed by taking an interpolating polynomial to replace either f ( z n ) or f ′ ( z n ) . In six of the eight methods we have used a Hermite interpolating polynomial. The other two schemes use inverse interpolation. We discovered that the eighth order methods based on Jarratt’s optimal fourth order methods perform well and those based on King’s or Kung–Traub’s methods do not. In all cases tested, the replacement of f ( z ) by Hermite interpolation is better than the replacement of the derivative, f ′ ( z ) .},

	abstract = {The expansion formula has been presented for Slater-type orbitals with noninteger principal quantum numbers (noninteger n-STOs), which involves conventional STOs (integer n-STOs) with the same center. By the use of this expansion formula, arbitrary multielectron multicenter molecular integrals over noninteger n-STOs are expressed in terms of counterpart integrals over integer n-STOs with a combined infinite series formula. The convergence of the method is tested for two-center overlap, nuclear attraction, and two-electron one-center integrals, due to the scarcity of the literature, and fair uniform convergence and great numerical stability under wide changes in molecular parameters is achieved. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Two-center overlap integrals are expressed as finite sum of Gaunt coefficients and auxiliary functions S Ln,n′(p, t). Special attention is paid to the efficient calculation of this auxiliary function by introducing analytic and recurrence relations. In order to test the accuracy of the formula for two-center overlap integrals, we performed an extensive study in which quantum numbers, orbital exponents, and internuclear distances were varied over wide ranges. We found that the method presented here for two-center overlap integrals is fully reliable for very high quantum numbers and the computation times are very low. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {A unified analytical treatment of overlap integrals over Slater-type orbitals, using the Fourier transform method, is presented. Our approach leads to considerable simplification of the derivation of analytical representations for the overlap integrals over Slater type orbitals. In this approach, the representations of overlap integrals with both the same and different screening parameters have been obtained with the help of the Rayleigh expansion of a plane wave in terms of spherical Bessel functions and spherical harmonics. Analytical expressions obtained by this method have been expressed in terms of Gaunt coefficients, which are the product of spherical harmonics, Gegenbauer, and binomial coefficients. These overlap integrals have also been calculated with respect to the differences in n1 − l1 and n2 − l2 numbers that are even or odd. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Int J Quantum Chem, 2004},

Different from the previous work, in this paper we consider a new method of matrix rational interpolation, with rectangular real or complex interpolated matrices and distinct real or complex interpolation points. Based on an axiomatic definition for the generalized inverse matrix rational interpolants (GMRI), \{GMRI\} are constructed in the following two forms: (i) Thiele-type continued fraction expression; (ii) an explicit determinantal formula for the denominator scalar polynomials and for the numerator matrix polynomials, which are of Lagrange-type expression. As a direct application of GMRI, a matrix rational extrapolation is introduced.},

The rational interpolants are of the continued fraction form, with scalar denominator. In this respect the approach is essentially different from that of Bose and Basu (1980) where a rational matrix-valued approximant with matrix-valued numerator and denominator is used for the approximation of a bivariate matrix power series. The matrix quotients are based on the generalized inverse for a matrix introduced by Gu Chuanqing and Chen Zhibing (1995) which is found to be effective in continued fraction interpolation. A sufficient condition of existence is obtained. Some important conclusions such as characterisation and uniqueness are proven respectfully. The inner connection between two type interpolating functions is investigated. Some examples are given so as to illustrate the results in the paper.},

	abstract = {Laplace transform is a powerful method for enabling solving differential equation in engineering and science. Using the Laplace transform for solving differential equations, however, sometimes leads to solutions in the Laplace domain that are not readily invertible to the real domain by analytical means. Numerical inversion methods are then used to convert the obtained solution from the Laplace domain into the real domain. Four inversion methods are evaluated in this paper. Several test functions, which arise in engineering applications, are used to evaluate the inversion methods. We also show that each of the inversion methods is accurate for a particular case. This study shows that among all these methods, the Fourier transform inversion technique is the most powerful but also the most computationally expensive. Stehfest’s method, which is used in many engineering applications is easy to implement and leads to accurate results for many problems including diffusion-dominated ones and solutions that behave like e−t type functions. However, this method fails to predict et type functions or those with an oscillatory response, such as sine and wave functions.},

In the particular case where the terms of the sequence to be transformed are the partial sums of a formal power series, this transformation leads to Padé-type approximants. Then, using various operators, some extensions of Drummond's process are proposed, and their properties are given. A new expression for the E-transformation, using generalized divided differences, is obtained, and it is also generalized. The recurrence relation for these differences can be used for its implementation, and the Ford–Sidi algorithm is also related to them. Lubkin's T and W-transformations, which could be related to Drummond's, are discussed in Appendix A.},

	abstract = {Abstract Several optimal eighth order methods to obtain simple roots are analyzed. The methods are based on two step, fourth order optimal methods and a third step of modified Newton. The modification is performed by taking an interpolating polynomial to replace either f ( z n ) or f ′ ( z n ) . In six of the eight methods we have used a Hermite interpolating polynomial. The other two schemes use inverse interpolation. We discovered that the eighth order methods based on Jarratt’s optimal fourth order methods perform well and those based on King’s or Kung–Traub’s methods do not. In all cases tested, the replacement of f ( z ) by Hermite interpolation is better than the replacement of the derivative, f ′ ( z ) .},

	abstract = {Abstract Cu(I) complexes often show transitions of distinct metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) character. This can lead to small energy separations between the lowest singlet \{S1\} and triplet \{T1\} state. Hence, thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and, if applied to electroluminescent devices, singlet harvesting can become highly effective. In this contribution, we introduce the \{TADF\} mechanism and identify crucial parameters that are necessary to optimize materials properties, in particular, with respect to short emission decay times and high quantum yields at ambient temperature. In different case studies, we present a photophysical background for a deeper understanding of the materials properties. Accordingly, we elucidate strategies for obtaining high quantum yields. These are mainly based on enhancing the intrinsic rigidity of the complexes and of their environment. Efficient \{TADF\} essentially requires small energy separations ?E(S1?T1) with preference below about 1000 cm-1 (?120 meV). This is achievable with complexes that exhibit small spatial HOMO?LUMO overlap. Thus, energy separations below 300 cm-1 (?37 meV) are obtained, giving short radiative \{TADF\} decay times of less than 5 ?s. In a case study, it is shown that the \{TADF\} properties may be tuned or the \{TADF\} effect can even be turned off. However, very small ?E(S1?T1) energy separations are related to small radiative rates or small oscillator strengths of the \{S1\} ? \{S0\} transitions due to the (required) small HOMO?LUMO overlap, as discussed in a further case study. Moreover, large spin?orbit coupling (SOC) of the triplet state to higher lying singlet states can induce an additional phosphorescence decay path that leads to a luminescence consisting of \{TADF\} and phosphorescence, thus leading to a combined singlet harvesting and triplet harvesting mechanism. This gives an overall reduction of the decay time. Finally, in a strongly simplified model, the \{SOC\} efficiency is traced back to easily obtainable results from \{DFT\} calculations.},

	abstract = {A divergent perturbation series is known to yield very unreliable results for observables even at moderate coupling strengths. One of the most popular techniques in handling such series is to express them as rational functions, but it is often faithful only for small coupling. We outline here how one can gain considerable advantages in the large-coupling regime by properly embedding known asymptotic scaling relations for selected observables during construction of the aforesaid Padé approximants. Three new bypass routes are explored in this context. The first approach involves a weighted geometric mean of two neighboring PA. The second idea is to consider series for specific ratios of observables. The third strategy is to express observables as functionals of the total energy in the form of series expansions. Symanzik's scaling relation, and the virial and Hellmann–Feynman theorems, are used at appropriate places to aid each of the strategies. Pilot calculations on the ground-state perturbation series of certain observables for the quartic anharmonic oscillator problem reveal readily the benefit and novelty. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

This method is based upon Chebyshev tau approximation together with Chebyshev operational matrix of Caputo fractional differentiation. Such approach has the advantage of reducing the problem to the solution of a system of algebraic equations, which may then be solved by any standard numerical technique. We apply this general method to solve four specific examples. In each of the examples considered, the numerical results show that the proposed method is of high accuracy and is efficient for solving the time-dependent fractional diffusion equations.},

	abstract = {Performing quantum chemical integral evaluation directly, without recursion and without direct coupling of angular momenta according to the rotation group is analyzed. The rotation group limits the structure of these closed-form expressions. The result of all cross differentiation is a rotational invariant. Closed-form expressions are obtained for the general three- and four-center Gaussian integral. The solid harmonic addition formula can be used to express these integrals as sums of products of an exponent-independent (angular) factor and a molecular-orientation-independent (exponential) factor in a variety of ways. The results are products of two such factors summed over the set of distinct, relevant polynomials of the exponents. The coefficients of these polynomials, angular factors, are complicated but common to all n-center matrix elements and independent of any type of contraction. Derivatives must be obtained using the product rule.

	abstract = {A method for the calculation of one-electron two-center integrals is described. Using an ellipsoidal coordinate system, both the overlap, kinetic energy, and nuclear attraction integrals are expressed in terms of the so-called sigma function introduced by Baba-Ahmed et al. [A. Baba-Ahmed and J. Gayoso, Int. J. Quant. Chem. 23, 71 (1983), Eq. (51)] and which is easily programmed for a computer. The present investigation offers an advantage in that general formulas are derived which facilitate computation of the overlap and related two-center integrals over all Slater-type orbitals (STOs) with eventual nonintegral values of the principal quantum number. The proposed algorithm permits to avoid the procedure of interpolation [A. Baba-Ahmed and J. Gayoso, Theor. Chim. Acta, 62, 507 (1983), Eqs. 11–14] used to overcome the difficulty introduced by the presence of nonintegral quantum numbers. Finally, numerical aspects of the proposed algorithm are analyzed and comparisons with other approaches are given. © 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc. Int J Quant Chem 63: 843–852, 1997},

Comparison with ab initio and experimental data indicates that DFT exhibit results of similar quality as explicitly correlated methods which indicates that it indeed is a viable approach for singlet–triplet transitions. O3 provides an intriguing example in that a systematic investigation of the singlet–triplet transition moment of its Wulf band indicates a clear advantage of the DFT technique despite the multiconfigurational character of the electronic structure of this molecule. The electronic spin–spin coupling and the hyperfine nuclear coupling constants have also been calculated in order to further characterize the triplet state in the spectra of the investigated systems.},

	abstract = {Abstract There are very few optimal fourth order methods for solving nonlinear algebraic equations having roots of multiplicity {\textbackslash}$^{\textrm{st\$}}$\$ root. The methods are usually compared by evaluating the computational efficiency and the efficiency index. In this paper all the methods have the same efficiency, since they are of the same order and use the same information. Frequently, comparisons of the various schemes are based on the number of iterations required for convergence, number of function evaluations, and/or amount of \{CPU\} time. If a particular algorithm does not converge or if it converges to a different solution, then that particular algorithm is thought to be inferior to the others. The primary flaw in this type of comparison is that the starting point represents only one of an infinite number of other choices. Here we use the basin of attraction idea to recommend the best fourth order method. The basin of attraction is a method to visually comprehend how an algorithm behaves as a function of the various starting points.},

	abstract = {Gaunt coefficients express angular momentum conservation rules. They are therefore required in the combination of atomic orbitals. In this case, the angular factors are spherical harmonics and the Gaunt coefficients appear when their products are linearized. The Gaunt coefficients may be pre-calculated and stored. This work describes new index functions for storing and retrieving the required Gaunt coefficients that are (almost) all nonzero. This strategy is closely related to that of Rasch and Yu, who have compared retrieval to that using recurrence relations and found it to be at least 20 times faster. Some improvements to their work will be found here and the index functions used are different. Only a few arithmetic operations are required to generate the index; therefore, its evaluation and handling takes a negligible time compared to its applications, notably molecular electronic integral evaluation. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Two procedures for obtaining accurate gaussian expansions have been compared for the required extended precision arithmetic. The first is based on Gaussian quadratures and the second on direct optimization. Both use the Maple computer algebra system. Numerical results are tabulated and compared with previous work. Special cases are found to agree before pushing the optimization technique further.

A variety of concrete numerical examples and relevant results are extensively treated to verify the underlying theoretical development.

The nonlinear D transformation, which is probably the most effective general approach for increasing the rate of convergence of semi-infinite oscillatory integrals, is presented. Molecular integrals over STFs are expressed as finite linear combinations of integrals over B functions. The basis set of B functions is suitable to apply the Fourier transform method, which led to analytic expressions, involving highly oscillatory functions, for molecular integrals. Efficient algorithms based on the D transformation are now developed for a numerical evaluation of molecular integrals over STFs. Numerical results that we obtained with linear and nonlinear molecules, and which are in agreement with those obtained using existing codes (Alchemy, STOP, and ADGGSTNGINT), show that the algorithms described in this work are relevant. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Subsequently, we (1) exhibit the foundational relations behind the complex-plane extension to a general Levin-type sequence convergence accelerator, (2) specialize this analysis to one member of the Levin transform family (the MWA), (3) address and circumvent restrictions, arising for two-dimensional integrals associated with wave dynamics problems, through minimal complex-plane detour restrictions and a novel partition of the integration domain, (4) develop and compare two formulations based on standard/real-axis \{MWA\} variants, and (5) present validation results and convergence characteristics for one of these two formulations.},

This work shows how the conditions of applicability for these transformations are readily proven to be satisfied using the Axiom symbolic computation system. Axiom also provides exact values of the integrals for comparison.

The norm of these matrices grows at the optimal rate O(N**2) for N-by-N matrices, in contrast to standard pseudospectral constructions that result in O(N**4) growth of the norm. The smaller norm has a big advantage when using the derivative matrix for solving time dependent problems such as wave propagation. The construction is based on representing the derivative operator as an integral kernel, and does not rely on the interpolating polynomials. In particular, we construct second derivative matrices that incorporate Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions on an interval and on the disk, but the method can be used to construct a wide variety of commonly used operators for solving \{PDEs\} and integral equations. The construction can be used with any quadrature, including traditional Gauss�Legendre quadratures, but we have found that by using quadratures based on prolate spheroidal wave functions, we can achieve a near optimal sampling rate close to two points per wavelength, even for non-periodic problems. We provide numerical results for the new construction and demonstrate that the construction achieves similar or better accuracy than traditional pseudospectral derivative matrices, while resulting in a norm that is orders of magnitude smaller than the standard construction. To demonstrate the advantage of the new construction, we apply the method for solving the wave equation in constant and discontinuous media and for solving \{PDEs\} on the unit disk. We also present two compression algorithms for applying the derivative matrices in O(N\&\#xa0;log\&\#xa0;N) operations.},

By the use of this expansion formula, arbitrary multielectron multicenter molecular integrals over noninteger n-STOs are expressed in terms of counterpart integrals over integer n-STOs with a combined infinite series formula. The convergence of the method is tested for two-center overlap, nuclear attraction, and two-electron one-center integrals, due to the scarcity of the literature, and fair uniform convergence and great numerical stability under wide changes in molecular parameters is achieved. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Two-center overlap integrals are expressed as finite sum of Gaunt coefficients and auxiliary functions S Ln,n′(p, t). Special attention is paid to the efficient calculation of this auxiliary function by introducing analytic and recurrence relations. In order to test the accuracy of the formula for two-center overlap integrals, we performed an extensive study in which quantum numbers, orbital exponents, and internuclear distances were varied over wide ranges. We found that the method presented here for two-center overlap integrals is fully reliable for very high quantum numbers and the computation times are very low. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Our approach leads to considerable simplification of the derivation of analytical representations for the overlap integrals over Slater type orbitals. In this approach, the representations of overlap integrals with both the same and different screening parameters have been obtained with the help of the Rayleigh expansion of a plane wave in terms of spherical Bessel functions and spherical harmonics. Analytical expressions obtained by this method have been expressed in terms of Gaunt coefficients, which are the product of spherical harmonics, Gegenbauer, and binomial coefficients. These overlap integrals have also been calculated with respect to the differences in n1 − l1 and n2 − l2 numbers that are even or odd. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Int J Quantum Chem, 2004},

	abstract = {The standard series expansion that has long been employed to evaluate one-center correlated three-electron integrals is converted into a different form. The alternative expression obtained allows convergence accelerator techniques to be directly applied in a very effective manner. The resulting expansion is found to be numerically stable, in contrast to the series obtained when convergence accelerator techniques are applied to the standard expansion. Using this approach, the increase in computational speed is found to be very significant for the most slowly converging integrals. Some representative values are presented for a number of three-electron correlated integrals calculated using the method suggested herein.},

Further acceleration of the convergence rate is attained by varying a free parameter from step to step using information available from the previous step. This approach leads to a family of two-step self-accelerating methods with memory whose order of convergence is at least 2 + 5 ≈ 4.236 and even 2 + 6 ≈ 4.449 in special cases.

In this work, the relative merits of various exponential-type orbitals (ETOs) are investigated for solving problems of interest to nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), while showing how they are related mathematically. The preferred ETOs will be shown to be the hydrogenic orbitals and similar Coulomb Sturmians. Slater-type functions (STFs) will be compared with them, and suitable equivalent (seldom used) combinations given. The correct shielding of the nucleus, resulting from radial factors of hydrogenic orbitals, is finally shown to be essential in the evaluation of precise nuclear shielding tensors for NMR spectroscopy of molecules using ab initio or DFT methods. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {In dieser Arbeit werden analytische Darstellungen und numerische Verfahren zur Berechnung der im Rahmen von nicht-relativistischen LCAO-MO-SCF-Rechnungen auftretenden Molekülintegrale für eine spezielle Klasse exponentialartiger Funktionen untersucht. Bei den Funktionen handelt es sich um die sogenannten B-Funktionen, die durch eine besonders einfache Fourier-Transformierte und eine sehr einfache Laplace-Darstellung ausgezeichnet sind. Damit sind B-Funktionen unter den exponentialartigen Funktionen prädestiniert für die Anwendung der Fourier-Transformationsmethode. Der skalare Anteil der B-Funktionen ist im wesentlichen durch eine reduzierte Bessel-Funktion gegeben. Bei diesen Untersuchungen werden Integraltransformationsmethoden zugrundegelegt. Dazu gehören die bereits genannte Fourier-Transformationsmethode und die Bessel-Transformationsmethode, die auf einer neuentdeckten, eindimensionalen Integraldarstellung für das Produkt zweier beliebiger reduzierter Bessel-Funktionen beruht, aus der eindimensionale Integraldarstellungen für zweizentrige Dichten zweier B-Funktionen hergeleitet werden. Diese zweizentrigen Dichten und ihre Fourier-Transformierten kann man aber als wesentlichen Baustein von mehrzentrigen Molekülintegralen mit B-Funktionen auffassen. Die Verwendung dieser Transformationsmethoden erlaubt folgerichtig die Herleitung einer Reihe von neuen Darstellungen für Molekülintegrale mit B-Funktionen. Numerisch werden vor allem Integraldarstellungen für Molekülintegrale mit B-Funktionen untersucht, die man mit der Fourier-Transformationsmethode herleiten kann. Für die numerische Auswertung dieser Integraldarstellungen werden neue Quadraturverfahren eingeführt. Besondere Berücksichtigung dabei findet der Fall stark unterschiedlicher Exponentialparameter, für den herkömmliche Methoden Schwierigkeiten haben. Durch eingehende Analyse wird als Grund dieser Schwierigkeiten das Auftreten von bestimmten Gewichtsfunktionen festgestellt. Diese Gewichtsfunktionen verursachen scharfe Spitzen, die die numerische Quadratur stark erschweren. Dieses Problem wird gelöst mit Hilfe von speziellen Koordinatentransformationen, den Möbius-Transformationen, und den darauf aufbauenden, neuen Quadraturverfahren. - Abschnitt 1: Einleitung (Quantenchemische Näherungsverfahren, Übersicht über die Arbeit und Abgrenzung des Themas) Abschnitt 2: Zusammenstellung wichtiger Definitionen und Bezeichnungen Abschnitt 3: Allgemeine Eigenschaften von B-Funktionen und Produkten von B-Funktionen Abschnitt 4: Integraltransformationsmethoden zur Behandlung von Molekülintegralen mit B-Funktionen Abschnitt 5: Numerische Quadraturverfahren bei Molekülintegralen mit B-Funktionen Abschnitt 6: Ein-Elektron-Integrale bei B-Funktionen: Fourier-Transformierte von Produkten zweier B-Funktionen, Überlappungsintegrale und verwandte Integrale Abschnitt 7: Ein-Elektron-Integrale mit B-Funktionen: Kernanziehungsintegrale Abschnitt 8: Zwei-Elektronen-Integrale mit B-Funktionen Anhang A: Einige Details über reduzierte Bessel-Funktionen Anhang B: Einige Größen mit Bezug zur Kugeldrehgruppe Anhang C: Programmtechnische Details Anhang D: Zweizentrige Produkte zweier B-Funktionen: Rekursionen Anhang E: Umrechnung von Laguerre-Regeln Anhang F: Zur Implementierung der Regel W\$”\$ Anhang G: Eigenschaften der Sigma-Funktionen},

Numerical experiments comparing the proposed method with other existing methods which are MATLAB’s functions expm and funm show that our approach is also very effective and reliable for computing the matrix exponential .

Two methods for implementing the LSC-IVR/classical Wigner which are in principle feasible to be combined with general force fields or even ab initio electronic structure methods have been reviewed. One is the local Gaussian approximation with the imaginary time path integral approach, the other is the quantum thermal bath method.

We compare the Lanczos algorithm in the 1987 implementation by Cullum and Willoughby with the shift-and-invert techniques in the implicitly restarted Lanczos method and in the Jacobi-Davidson method. Our preconditioning approaches for the shift-and-invert symmetric indefinite linear system are based on maximum weighted matchings and algebraic multilevel incomplete $^{\textrm{T\$}}$\$ factorizations. These techniques can be seen as a complement to the alternative idea of using more complete pivoting techniques for the highly ill-conditioned symmetric indefinite Anderson matrices. We demonstrate the effectiveness and the numerical accuracy of these algorithms. Our numerical examples reveal that recent algebraic multilevel preconditioning solvers can accelerate the computation of a large-scale eigenvalue problem corresponding to the Anderson model of localization by several orders of magnitude.},

Moreover a quadratic nonlinear majorant for a nonlinear operator, according to the conditions laid upon it, is built. A priori and a posteriori estimations of the method�s error are received. The method needs almost the same number of computations as the classical Secant method, but has a higher order of convergence.

	abstract = {Organic light emitting diodes based on fluorophores with a propensity for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) are able to circumvent limitations imposed on device efficiency by spin statistics. Molecules with a propensity for TADF necessarily have two properties: a small gap between the lowest lying singlet and triplet excited states and a large transition dipole moment for fluorescence. In this work, we demonstrate the use of a genetic algorithm to search a region of chemical space for molecules with these properties. This algorithm is based on a flexible and intuitive representation of the molecule as a tree data structure, in which the nodes correspond to molecular fragments. Our implementation takes advantage of hybrid parallel graphics processing unit accelerated computer clusters to allow efficient sampling while retaining a reasonably accurate description of the electronic structure (in this case, CAM-B3LYP/6-31G**). In total, we have identified 3792 promising candidate fluorophores from a chemical space containing 1.26 � 10**6 molecules. This required performing electronic structure calculations on only 7518 molecules, a small fraction of the full space. Several novel classes of molecules which show promise as fluorophores are presented.},

	abstract = {"Let F(z) be a vector-valued function, F: C - CN, which is analytic at z=0 and meromorphic in a neighbourhood of z=0, and let its Maclaurin series be given. In this work we develop vector-valued rational approximation procedures for F(z) by applying vector extrapolation methods to the sequence of partial sums of its Maclaurin series. We analyze some of the algebraic and analytic properties of the rational approximations thus obtained and show that they are akin to Pad� approximants. In particular, we prove a Koenig-type theorem concerning their poles and a de Montessus-type theorem concerning their uniform convergence. We show how "optimal" approximations to multiple poles and to Laurent expansions about these poles can be constructed. Extensions of the procedures above and the accompanying theoretical results to functions defined in arbitrary linear spaces is also considered. One of the most interesting and immediate applications of the results of this work is to the matrix eigenvalue problem. In a new work we exploit the developments of the present work to devise bona fide generalizations of the classical power method that are especially suitable for very large and sparse matrices. These generalizations can be used to approximate simultaneously several of the largest distinct eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors and invariant subspaces of arbitrary matrices, which may or may not be diagonalizable, and are very closely related with known Krylov subspace methods.

	abstract = {Carbene–Au–amide (CMA) type complexes, in which the amide and carbene ligands act as an electron donor (D) and acceptor (A), respectively, can exhibit strong delayed fluorescence (DF) from a ligand to ligand charge transfer (LLCT) excited state. Although the coplanar donor–acceptor (D-A) conformation has been suggested to be a crucial factor favoring radiative decay of the charge-transfer excited state, the geometric structural factor underpinning the excited-state mechanism of CMA complexes remains an open question. We herein develop a new class of carbene–Au–carbazolate complexes by introducing large aromatic substituents onto the carbazolate ligand, the presence of which are conceived to restrict the rotation of the Au–N bond and thus confine a twisted D-A conformation in both ground and excited states. A highly twisted D-A orientation is found for the complexes in their crystal structures. Photophysical studies reveal that the twisted conformation induces a decrease in the gap (ΔEST) between the lowest singlet excited state (S1) and the triplet manifold (T1) and thus a faster reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) from T1 to S1 at the expense of oscillator strength for an S1 radiative transition. In comparison with the coplanar analogue, the twisted complexes exhibit comparable or improved DF with quantum yields of up to 94\% and short emission lifetimes down to sub-microseconds. The tuning of excited-state dynamics has been well interpreted by density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations, which unveil much faster RISC rates for twisted complexes. Solution-processed organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on the new CMA complexes show promising performances with almost negligible efficiency rolloff at a brightness of 1000 cd m–2. This work implies that neither a coplanar ground-state D-A conformation nor a dynamic rotation of the M–N bond is the key to the realization of efficient DF for CMA complexes.},

	abstract = {A principal tool for the construction of the addition theorem of a function f is the translation operator er′⋅∇, which generates f(r+r′) by doing a three-dimensional Taylor expansion of f around r. In atomic and molecular quantum mechanics, one is usually interested in irreducible spherical tensors. In such a case, the application of the translation operator in its Cartesian form ex′∂/∂xey′∂/∂yez′∂/∂z leads to serious technical problems. A much more promising approach consists of the use of an operator expansion for er′⋅∇ which contains exclusively irreducible spherical tensors. This expansion contains as differential operators the Laplacian ∇2 and the spherical tensor gradient operator 𝒴 lm(∇), which is an irreducible spherical tensor of rank l. Thus, if 𝒴 lm(∇) is applied to another spherical tensor, the angular part of the resulting expression is completely determined by angular momentum coupling, whereas the radial part is obtained by differentiating the radial part of the spherical tensor with respect to r. Consequently, the systematic use of the spherical tensor gradient operator leads to a considerable technical simplification. In this way, the originally three-dimensional expansion problem in x, y, and z is reduced to an essentially one-dimensional expansion problem in r. The practical usefulness of this approach is demonstrated by constructing the Laplace expansion of the Coulomb potential as well as the addition theorems of the regular and irregular solid harmonics and of the Yukawa potential. © 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

Because the molecular multicenter integrals of the much simpler Slater-type functions are notoriously difficult, it is not at all obvious why B functions should offer any advantages. However, B functions have Fourier transforms of exceptional simplicity, which greatly simplifies many of their molecular multicenter integrals. This article discusses the historical development of B functions from the perspective of the interaction between mathematics and theoretical chemistry, which traditionally has not been very good. Nevertheless, future progress in theoretical chemistry depends very much on a fertile interaction with neighboring disciplines. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Int J Quantum Chem, 2009},

	abstract = {Addition theorems can be constructed by doing three-dimensional Taylor expansions according to f(r+r′)=exp (r′⋅∇)f(r). Since, however, one is normally interested in addition theorems of irreducible spherical tensors, the application of the translation operator in its Cartesian form exp (x′∂/∂x)exp (y′∂/∂y)exp (z′∂/∂z) would lead to enormous technical problems. A better alternative consists in using a series expansion for the translation operator exp (r′⋅∇) involving powers of the Laplacian ∇2 and spherical tensor gradient operators {\textbackslash}textbackslashdocumentclassarticle{\textbackslash}textbackslashpagestyleempty{\textbackslash}textbackslashbegindocument\${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcalYˆm\_{\textbackslash}textbackslashell({\textbackslash}textbackslashnabla)\${\textbackslash}textbackslashenddocument, which are irreducible spherical tensors of ranks zero and ℓ, respectively (Santos, F. D. Nucl Phys A 1973, 212, 341). In this way, it is indeed possible to derive addition theorems by doing three-dimensional Taylor expansions (Weniger, E. J. Int J Quantum Chem 2000, 76, 280). The application of the translation operator in its spherical form is particularly simple in the case of B functions and leads to an addition theorem with a comparatively compact structure. Since other exponentially decaying functions like Slater-type functions, bound-state hydrogenic eigenfunctions, and other functions based on generalized Laguerre polynomials can be expressed by simple finite sums of B functions, the addition theorems for these functions can be written down immediately. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {Some methods for the convergence acceleration of the M\{{\textbackslash}o\}ller-Plesset perturbation series for the correlation energy are discussed. The order-by-order summation is less effective than the Feenberg series. The latter is obtained by renormalizing the unperturbed Hamilton operator by a constant factor that is optimized for the third order energy. In the fifth order case, the Feenberg series can be improved by order-dependent optimization of the parameter. Alternatively, one may use Pad\{{\textbackslash}'e\} approximants or a further method based on effective characteristic polynomials to accelerate the convergence of the perturbation series. Numerical evidence is presented that, besides the Feenberg-type approaches, suitable Pad\{{\textbackslash}'e\} approximants, and also the effective second order characteristic polynomial, are excellent tools for correlation energy estimation.},

	abstract = {The subject of fractional calculus (that is, the calculus of integrals and derivatives of any arbitrary real or complex order) has gained considerable popularity and importance during the past over four decades, due mainly to its demonstrated applications in numerous seemingly diverse and widespread fields of mathematical, physical, engineering and statistical sciences. Various operators of fractional-order derivatives as well as fractional-order integrals do indeed provide several potentially useful tools for solving differential and integral equations, and various other problems involving special functions of mathematical physics as well as their extensions and generalizations in one and more variables. The main object of this survey-cum-expository article is to present a brief elementary and introductory overview of the theory of the integral and derivative operators of fractional calculus and their applications especially in developing solutions of certain interesting families of ordinary and partial fractional “differintegral” equations. This general talk will be presented as simply as possible keeping the likelihood of non-specialist audience in mind.
